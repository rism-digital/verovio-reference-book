This book is intended to serve as a reference guide for how to work with Verovio, and is meant for users of all skill levels. The book is a collaborative work that brings together inputs from the many contributors to the Verovio projects under the editorial leadership of the RISM Digital Center team. 

This initial chapter gives an introduction to Verovio and the history of the project as well as an overview on how to use it.

The following two chapters provides a number of [tutorials](/first-steps), starting at the very basic and ending at advanced topics in notation. By the end of these you should have a very good understanding of how to use Verovio in its different forms, and how you can start to integrate it into your own work.

The chapter on [advanced-topics](/advanced-topics) provides some more in-depths explanation of specifics of Verovio.

The last chapters provides a [reference](/toolkit-reference) for the operations and options available. They also cover how to [build and install](/installing-or-building-from-sources) Verovio, including from the source code, and how to [contribute](/contributing) to the active development of Verovio.

The DOI [10.5448/7em6-my23](https://doi.org/10.5448/7em6-my23) identifies the currently applicable version of the book documenting the latest release of Verovio.
