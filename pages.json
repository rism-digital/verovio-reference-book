They each have their own internal structure and file formats. Furthermore, the music notation rendering engines of music notation editors are not very modular and cannot easily be used or integrated into other applications. Besides music notation editors, some music notation rendering engines are also available as command-line tools. These are easier to integrate than desktop applications, however with occasionally quite significant dependencies and requirements that limit the contexts in which their use is possible. This is the case for LilyPond, a very popular and powerful typesetting engine Such tools have been used for many years within the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) community for engraving scores encoded in MEI. Using them, however, meant converting the MEI to another encoding scheme that could be used as input format for the engraving tool. Whichever solution was used to do this, it remained clearly suboptimal. MEI users willing to benefit from all the strengths of MEI were facing the problem of not being able to render their data properly. Converting a music encoding format to another one is known to become quickly problematic. It is particularly true when converting from MEI markup that is rich and detailed, a feature that distinguishes MEI from other encoding schemes. With a conversion step, it is likely that not all the information will be preserved in the rendering, or at least only in cumbersome ways and with sometimes quite limited results. At that time, by about thirty years after the initial development of music notation software applications, the digital domain had significantly changed with the advent of the online world. For music notation, this translated into new possibilities but also new challenges to be faced. While most music notation engraving tools target PDF, this format is clearly not the ideal one in web-based environments. It can be published online, but some web browsers still require a dedicated viewer plugin to be installed for this to be possible. They yield inconsistent viewing and document browsing experiences, which is far from ideal. To embed PDF files directly in web pages code, they need to be converted to images, which creates an overhead and additional complications in the publication process, with often poor results in the display quality. Early stages In 2013, the RISM Digital Center launched the development of Verovio for rendering the music incipits or the RISM project. The main idea behind the development of Verovio was to implement a tool that could render the RISM music incipits directly but also to support MEI natively. That is, without having MEI converted to another format, either explicitly or internally in the software application used for rendering. With Verovio, the MEI markup is parsed and rendered as notation with a single tool and in one step. One of the reasons for choosing to implement a library from scratch rather than modifying an existing library was that it will allow to operate on a memory representation of MEI, which will make it significantly easier to render complex MEI features in the long run. Previous experience has indeed shown that modifying an existing solution can be very quick to develop at the beginning, but that the development curve eventually reaches a plateau. Another idea behind the development of Verovio was to have a tool that would be easy to use in web environments. Instead of targeting PDF output, Verovio uses the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format developed and maintained by the W3C. The advantage of SVG over other output formats, and Postscript and PDF in particular, is that it can easily be used in a web-based environment because it is rendered natively in most modern web browsers with no plug-in required. In addition, since SVG is a vector format, the output can also be used for high-quality printing, which means that it offers the best of both digital and paper-based worlds. With the same goal in mind, Verovio was designed to be light and fast and has no external dependencies, making it very flexible and easy to use or integrate into digital environments. Interacting with music encoding Today, partly in response to the development of MIR applications, rendering of music notation can be necessary in very different contexts, for example within standalone desktop applications, in server-side web application scenarios, or directly in a web browser. Music notation might need to be rendered for displaying search results or for visualising analysis outputs. Another example is score-following applications, where the passage currently played needs to be displayed and possibly highlighted. These are different use-cases of interactive applications where music notation plays a key role, including many cases where the notation itself has to be an interactive component. Several design features of the Verovio library make it highly suitable for interactive music notation applications. It is a software library that can run in a wide range of environments (and not a full software application) and it is light and fast. The JavaScript version of Verovio is particularly promising because it provides a fast in-browser music MEI typesetting engine that can easily be integrated into web-based applications. This setup makes it possible to design ground-breaking web applications where the MEI encoding is rendered on the fly. In such designs we can rethink the interface and avoid mimicking page output. We can instead adjust the layout dynamically to the screen of the device employed by the user. The layout can be calculated to fill the size of the screen, or interactively changed according to a zoom level adjusted by the user. This opens up new responsive web-interfaces to be designed and developed based on dynamic music notation reflow. This works particularly well with SVG, especially since it is now supported by all modern web browsers. However innovative the dynamic layout of music notation may be, it remains a very basic interaction. Verovio aims to go further and to produce a graphic output that can then be the foundation for more complex interactions. Because SVG is XML, it has an advantage over raster image formats in that every graphical element is addressable. This feature makes it intrinsically well suited for interaction, and this is also true for music notation. In a web environment, the addressability can be used for highlighting graphical elements such as notes or any other music symbols. One additional characteristic of SVG is that its XML tree can be structured as desired, and an innovative design feature of Verovio was to go further in the structuring of the output by leveraging this characteristic. Since Verovio implements the MEI structure internally, this key feature of SVG made it possible to preserve the MEI structure in the design of the SVG output in Verovio. Preserving the MEI structure in the SVG output is a considerable overhead in the rendering process but makes it a unique feature of Verovio. As a result, Verovio output in SVG is not the end of a unidirectional rendering process. Quite on the contrary, it should instead be seen as an intermediate layer standing between the MEI encoding and its rendering that can act as the cornerstone for a bi-directional interaction: from the encoding to the notation, but also from the notation to the encoding through the user interface. Design principles The basis for interactivity offered by MEI coupled with Verovio follows some important design principles. First for all, the principle of availability and discoverability. That is, all the content (e.g., all the MEI editorial variants) is available. Alternative text can be made discoverable, for example with CSS highlighting. It also follows the design principle of scalability. Verovio is light and fast. It can run on small devices, but it also supports large files in higher resource environments. They are also some technical principles that are followed as far as possible. They include reusability and durability. By providing only the interaction foundation and not making any assumption in interface design, especially with a software library that has no dependency, reusability is undeniably maximised. So is the durability, although durability is hard to predict in software development, particularly for digital humanities projects which have slow development cycles in comparison with the development of the technology itself. Reducing dependencies as much as possible is one way to increase durability. In the case of MEI rendering, keeping the rendering engine separate from larger applications that will use it is another way. In terms of editions and interface design, there is much still to invent. This will need to be done hand in hand with the development of MEI. It is obvious that merely imitating printed output in a digital environment will not be satisfactory. Most effort should be spent on developing the added value that digital environments can offer. Parallel with the development of the online world is the appearance of new devices, such as tablets with wireless network access. They offer new possibilities in terms of digital access and change the manner and location in which digital content can be read. Developing these possibilities will not preclude the co-existence of printed editions, which have and will continue to retain their own added value. The challenge now is neither to replicate nor to supplant existing media or applications, but to expand horizons by exploring new ways of conceiving the information to which we have access, and MEI and Verovio are a decisive and exciting step in this direction."},{"id":2,"title":"Use-case scenarios","url":"/introduction/use-cases.html","body":"Architecture possibilities Verovio is a C++ codebase that can be compiled and wrapped into different programming languages and integrated into various environments and several use-cases can be imagined for the Verovio toolkit. First of all, it can be built and used as a standalone command-line tool. This option is well suited to scripting environments and applications. The command-line tool can be used to render music notation files into SVG or into MIDI files. These files can be embedded in HTML files with everything happening on the server side. Verovio can also be used to convert data (e.g., MusicXML or Humdrum) to MEI. Typical use cases would be : generate SVG and MIDI from MEI documents or other supported formats, generate MEI documents from other supported formats (e.g., convert files). Resulting SVG or MEI documents can then be embedded in a HTML page or used as such. The JavaScript toolkit makes it possible to generate SVG and MIDI directly in the browser. It is easy to set up and platform independent. Interaction with the user can then be handled with basic JavaScript or CSS. An example of how to handle events is given in the tutorial. It is also possible to process the MEI via XSLT in the browser before loading it into Verovio. Both approaches can be combined: one may choose to process the MEI and to generate the SVG server side for better performance, and then handle interactions client side with JavaScript and CSS. Application examples Interactive applications in which the MEI and Verovio pair is being used are very diverse. In this section, we list some example application uses-cases based on this pair and where interaction is an important component. Most of the projects selected are research projects or research tools, but not only. Critical editions The Digital Interactive Mozart Edition (DIME) is a joint project of the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation and the Packard Humanities Institute in California. It is one example project in the field of digital critical editions that takes advantage of very rich and powerful markup possibilities offered by the MEI schema. In this context, interaction capabilities open completely new and welcome perspectives in interface design. Critical editions traditionally encompass extremely dense information networks that have to be laid out on paper with all the associated bi-dimensional constraints. Variant display is notoriously cumbersome and the information often has to be scattered between various part of the books (e.g., the critical notes referring to the music scores listed at the end of a volume). Genetic editing Genetic editing is still an exploratory field in music. In this context, MEI is in active development under the lead of the Beethovens Werkstatt project. In genetic editing, time is a key dimension to be taken into account in the representation of differences. The differences in genetic editing represent different stages of writing for which it is not always possible to determine clearly their scope, their order in time or even their content because it is not always readable. This yields potentially very complex and large datasets for which the music notation content cannot be visualised as a whole. Only subsets of the data can here be reasonably visualised at a time, and interaction is the perfect approach for allowing highlighting, selection and navigation in the data. Early music Thanks to the overall simple structure of its notation (e.g., monophony for chant), early music has often been at the forefront of development of digital projects. Nonetheless, most of the time they remained isolated because of the need to develop dedicated encoding schemes and tools. The Measuring Polyphony project, a repository of digital encoding of late medieval polyphony at Brandeis University, is a good example of a change. The same ecosystem as for CWMN is used here. The MEI modularity allows for precise representation of the mensural notation, and the development of MEI and Verovio allow, for the first time, early music notation to be properly encoded accurately regarding the ternary and binary durations in the music. Interaction perspectives can be seen for linking original notation and modern transcriptions, which remains desirable for non-expert audiences. Audio alignment Alignment of scores with audio recordings, also known as score following, is a typical music information retrieval task. The main challenge is to generate the alignment data taking into account the fact that performances vary in tempo and that sections of the score can be repeated in some performances. The Freischütz Digital is an example project where the alignment data is stored in MEI with synchronisation information at the measure level generated for multiple recordings. The playback is synchronised with Verovio using measure xml:id for following the score or jumping anywhere in it. Clicking anywhere on the score can conversely be used to jump to the corresponding place in the recording. In the case of this project, because the MEI data also contains mapping of the measures with their corresponding zone in the facsimile image of the handwritten manuscript, the same synchronisation can be realized with it. Music notation editing Interaction with music notation can take the form of data editing, either in a WYSIWYG manner or by allowing music encoding text editing. The Neon.js project for neume notation is an example of the former approach. It is currently going in-depth refactoring for switching from a previous ad-hoc rendering solution to Verovio rendering. The later editing approach is implemented in the Verovio Humdrum Viewer (VHV) project where editing of the encoding (Humdrum or MEI) is updated on the fly. The same setup has recently been integrated into Atom as a plugin package, MEI-tools-atom. In both the VHV and the Atom package, the rendered notation can be clicked to navigate in the encoding. Music addressability In music literature or in music practice, addressing music notation generally relies on movement names and measure numbers, and additionally voice or instrument names and beat numbers when necessary. However, there is no formalised concept behind this practical approach. Addressing music notation in the digital world has been recently the focus of the Enhancing Music Notation Addressability (EMA) project at the University of Maryland. The goal of the project is to develop a generic system for expressing addresses in music notation documents. In order to evaluate it, the project developed a web service with an API for addressing MEI documents, the Open MEI Addressability Service (OMAS). The Verovio rendering is used to display a selection. Conversely, the rendered music notation can serve as the basis for selecting interactively a zone to be transformed into an address in the music notation data. Visualisation Visualisation is an important field of research and experimentation in digital humanities. With digital publications and digital devices, interactivity significantly increases the visualisation possibilities. For example, the visualisation scope or perspective can change dynamically following the choice of the user or the content of the data. With dynamic music notation rendering, it is possible to augment it with additional visualisation layers as demonstrated by the performance analysis and re-synthesis of piano music PerformScore project at the Music and Audio Computing Lab. A player featuring score following for multiple performances to be selected by the user as seen with the Freichütz Digital project is enhanced here with the visualisation of additional characteristics of the performance being played. They include tempo and dynamic changes but also the intensity of individual notes through colour and opacity adjustment. Louder notes become darker with high opacity and softer notes thinner with low opacity. Composition Contemporary music compositions can rely directly on the distinct features of digital score technology. An example is the Chance Of Weather composition by Joseph Arkfeld based on Emily Dickinson’s poetic fragments “Fortitude - flanked with Melody”. The idea behind this project is to apply in the composition process the paradigm of fragment and variation as found in critical editions. The composition is made up of a set of fragments inspired by the poem and the encoding of the score is itself based on markup traditionally used for critical editions. Ultimately, the choice of the fragments for a particular instance of the composition is determined by an external data source, namely weather conditions (wind, cloud cover, temperature, etc.) at a geographical place to be chosen by the user. The weather conditions are transformed into a query that selects the corresponding fragments. Performance Interaction with music notation is quite common in the domain of performance. However, a significant breakthrough came on stage with the Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework and Climb!, a music composition that mixes the idea of classical virtuoso piece and computer game. The major innovation of the project is that the dataset is stored as Linked Data using MELD. Climb! is a non-linear composition also made from a set of fragments moving from the bottom to the top of a graph representing a mountain. The path of a performance is not pre-determined and changes at each performance. At some stages, the performer has to play some excerpts, whose accuracy is dynamically verified in order to decide if the performer can proceed to the next stage. Feedback to the performer can be provided by the highlighting of score fragments. Education In the field of music education, interactive applications are more and more common and increasingly sophisticated. They typically link music notation with recordings, but also with user feedback (measure tempo, tuning, etc.). They are often built as mobile device applications, such as the NomadPlay application. NomadPlay features a catalogue of recordings of a wide range of pieces from which the user can select his instrument. He can then rehearse the piece with the score of his instrument being displayed and synchronized with the recording but with the sound of his instrument removed. It is also possible to loop a difficult passage, or to change the tempo of the recording interactively."},{"id":3,"title":"Verovio licensing","url":"/introduction/licensing.html","body":"Verovio is licensed under the OSI-approved GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3). This means that Verovio can be used in any contexts that are compliant with the requirements of that license. In this section, we explain more concretely what you can do with it in your project, but also what is required or not allowed for you to do, and what we additionally recommend. What is allowed The LGPLv3 license allows you to use the Verovio library as-is in open-source projects that are compliant with this license. It can also be used in commercial products that are open-source or not. It can be a web application, a desktop application or a mobile one. The Verovio library can be embedded in the product and shipped with it without having your product itself to be open-source as long as the Verovio library is not modified and is dynamically linked to your product. What is required Whichever use you make of the library, you have to give visible credit to the Verovio library. For a web application, it has to be through a prominent notice on your web-site. For a mobile application, it has to be given in the metadata of the application (e.g., iOS App Store or the Google Play store). Here are some minimal examples to follow: Enote in the App Store Trala in Google Play NomadPlay web application Using Verovio in a product without giving credit is a clear license violation. However, it is also important to understand that, by giving the appropriate credits, you are not only fulfilling the very basic and free-of-charge requirements of the license but also supporting the community by recognizing its work. This will help us make Verovio better and more sustainable and will be beneficial to all users - including you - in the long-run. What is not allowed You are not allowed to make any modifications to the Verovio library without making all of your changes publicly available and under the original LGPLv3 license. For example, if you improve the layout algorithm, or add support for additional music notation elements, these improvements must be made open-source under LGPLv3. Not doing it is also a license violation and is un-supportive of the community. What is recommended Providing credit if you use Verovio, and making the source code of your modifications to the Verovio library available to the community, are the only minimal legal requirements. However, we strongly encourage you to go one step further and to ask for your changes to be integrated into the original code-base of Verovio with a pull-request to the rism-digital/verovio repository. Before your changes can be integrated into the repository, we will need you to accept the Verovio Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a standard procedure for open-source projects and will allow for the community to benefit directly from your work.

In this tutorial you will be building a small HTML page, with a minimal amount of JavaScript, to create an SVG rendering of an MEI file. In-depth technical expertise is not necessary, but you should be familiar with the basic principles of HTML to get the most out of this tutorial, and have access to a plain-text editor, preferably with facilities for automatically highlighting HTML and JavaScript code. (The Atom editor is a good choice if you need a recommendation.) By the end of this tutorial, you should understand the following: How to load the Verovio JavaScript library using the &lt;script&gt; tag; How to initialize Verovio, and how to set some basic rendering options; How to load an MEI file from a URL and pass it to Verovio to render; How to navigate between pages a multi-page score. Later tutorials will cover more in-depth topics, such as how to have more control over rendering options, how to interact with the rendered notation, and how to play the notation back using MIDI. Basic browser skills A good skill to have in working through these tutorials is how to access and use the JavaScript error console in your browser. Every modern browser comes with this facility. This feature is useful to see what might be causing problems since these problems may not be otherwise noticeable; your page just may not work, or it may not do what you expect. Accessing the JavaScript console is slightly different in each browser.

If you were building your own website, you may choose to host this on your own servers, but in this tutorial we will use a version that is hosted on the Verovio website. You can start with the following HTML page: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Save this in a plain text file somewhere on your hard-drive, and then open it with your browser. (The name does not matter, but it should end in .html; verovio.html is a good choice.) You should text in a large font that says “Hello Verovio!” but not much else. If you have your browser console open (discussed in the introduction), you should see no errors. To start Verovio, you should add the following to your page in the head, after the &lt;script&gt; tag that loads the Verovio toolkit: &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized = () =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); } }); &lt;/script&gt; (If you are unsure, scroll to the bottom of this page; the full example is given below.) When you refresh your page, you should still see nothing, and there should be no errors in the browser console. To help you understand what this is doing, let’s start from the inside out. The line tk = new verovio.toolkit(); creates a new instance of the Verovio toolkit. This is what we will eventually use to render the notation. However, we first need to wait until the Verovio library is fully downloaded and ready to use by your browser. The verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized line, and the document.addEventListener lines do just that – they tell your browser to wait until other things have happened before trying to work with Verovio. This is a good, safe way to ensure all the requirements are met before we try to start working with Verovio. Logging to the Console While you are developing, it can be useful to write little notes to yourself to let you know what types of data you have, or to see what is happening at any given point in your code. As you proceed to more advanced uses you may wish to explore the browser’s built-in debugger, but until then a quick and easy way to do this is to use your browser’s error console. In your page, just after the line where you instantiate a new Verovio toolkit, insert the following: console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); When you refresh your page, you can see this note to yourself appear in the browser console. If no other errors appear, this gives you a critical pieces of information: Your browser has reached that point in execution, which means it has successfully loaded and initialized Verovio. If you do not see this, go back through the examples to see where you may have gone wrong. If you still cannot find this, you can find the full example for this stage of the tutorial below. You may notice that Verovio prints some warnings to your browser console. We can ignore these options for this tutorial, but if you are working with your own encoded scores and see these warnings it may help you track down problems or unexpected behaviours when rendering your scores. End of Section 1 At the end of this first section you should have a working web page, with a message printed to your browser console, and no other errors showing up. In the next section we will look at how to load and render some basic music notation in this page. Full example &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized = () =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;"},{"id":7,"title":"Basic rendering","url":"/first-steps/basic-rendering.html","body":"At the end of part 1, we finished with a page that was successfully loading the Verovio library, but with nothing to display. In this part of the tutorial We will write some JavaScript that will fetch an MEI file from a URL, and then pass that MEI file to Verovio. This will turn the MEI file into an Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file that we can then embed in our page. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an image format that can be directly embedded into web pages. Vector graphics can be made larger or smaller with no pixellation, unlike other image formats you may be familiar with such as JPEG or PNG. Fetching MEI with JavaScript The first step is to fetch an MEI file from a URL. To do this, you can write the following in your HTML file, immediately after the console.log statement: fetch(\"https://www.verovio.org/examples/downloads/Schubert_Lindenbaum.mei\") .then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ) .then( (meiXML) =&gt; { let svg = tk.renderData(meiXML, {}); document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = svg; }); To break this down a bit, we start with a fetch statement with a URL; this tells your browser to try and load the file available at this address from a remote server. If it’s successful, then it should extract the XML data from the server: then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ). Finally, we take this MEI response and pass it off to our Verovio instance. Remember that we ‘started’ Verovio by creating a new Toolkit and assigning it to the variable tk? Well, now we are using this toolkit to render the MEI file. The result, as you might guess by the variable name (let svg = ...), will be some SVG. Once we have this SVG, we look through the page for HTML element with the id of “notation”. You should see a &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; line already in your HTML file. We set the content of this element (the innerHTML) to the SVG output of Verovio. If you refresh your HTML page now, you should see a rendered version of a Schubert lied, “Der Lindenbaum”. Congratulations! If you do not see this, go back and double-check that you do not have any errors in your browser console. End of Section 2 At the end of this section, you should have a page with some rendered music notation on it. It’s probably a bit too big, though, to read comfortably on your screen. You may also be wondering how Verovio handles larger scores, with lots of pages. We will answer these two questions in the next sections by looking at how we can control the layout options, and how we can use JavaScript to navigate the score dynamically. Full example &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized = async _ =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); fetch(\"https://www.verovio.org/examples/downloads/Schubert_Lindenbaum.mei\") .then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ) .then( (meiXML) =&gt; { let svg = tk.renderData(meiXML, {}); document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = svg; }); } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;"},{"id":8,"title":"Layout options","url":"/first-steps/layout-options.html","body":"Now that we have successfully rendered an MEI file to a web page, we can start to explore how to customize the SVG output. There are many possible options, most of which you will never need. To start, we will first try and reduce the size of the image output, to demonstrate how we can scale the music notation to fit the screen. Passing options to Verovio Passing options to Verovio is as easy as creating a set of key and value pairs, and using the setOptions method on the toolkit. To scale the output we will use the scale option given as percentage of the normal (100) output. Add the following to your page, after we have instantiated the toolkit but before we render the data: tk.setOptions({ scale: 30 }); When you refresh your page, you should see your score scaled to 30% of its original size. Try experimenting with other values to see their effects! (Hint: you can use sizes above 100%.) Defaults All of the options have default values. You can use the getOptions method to view the list of all the options and their default values. We will use the browser console to explore these defaults. Add the following line: console.log(\"Verovio options:\", tk.getOptions()); // for the default values console.log(\"Verovio options:\", tk.getDefaultOptions()); When you refresh your page and open your browser’s console you should see the text “Verovio options:” followed by a small disclosure triangle. Clicking this triangle will produce a long list of options that you can pass to setOptions. Let’s try a few more. Change the page orientation You may have noticed that, by default, Verovio renders the score in “portrait” orientation; that is, the width of the score is shorter than the length. To change this, we can use the landscape and adjustPageWidth options: tk.setOptions({ scale: 30, landscape: true, adjustPageWidth: true }); When you refresh the page you should notice that your SVG has changed orientation! But wait… the score is now cut off! Where did the rest of it go? It turns out that Verovio has the ability to split scores into “pages” automatically. When it calculates the notation cannot fit on the current page, Verovio will automatically push it to the next page. Adjusting the different options will have an effect on this calculation, so it is worth looking through the options that we printed out, and trying some on your own. You may wish to change the pageWidth option, for example, to a bigger or smaller value and see what the result is. End of Section 3 In this section we have explored Verovio’s default options, and looked at how to adjust them to change the rendering output. In the next section we will look at how we can adjust these options dynamically, using on-screen controls to provide a user interface for building interactive music notation displays. Full example &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized = async _ =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); tk.setOptions({ scale: 30, landscape: true, adjustPageWidth: true }); console.log(\"Verovio options:\", tk.getOptions()); fetch(\"https://www.verovio.org/examples/downloads/Schubert_Lindenbaum.mei\") .then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ) .then( (meiXML) =&gt; { let svg = tk.renderData(meiXML, {}); document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = svg; }); } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;"},{"id":9,"title":"Score navigation","url":"/first-steps/score-navigation.html","body":"In this final part of the introductory tutorial, we will take what we have learned about Verovio and produce an interactive score, where your users can adjust the behaviour of Verovio and see the display updated. Creating the controls Before we start we will need to create some HTML form controls. These controls will do the following: A slider to adjust the scaling factor; “Next page” and “Previous page” buttons for navigating the score; A checkbox for adjusting the orientation (portrait or landscape) If you are not familiar with how HTML form controls are created, you may wish to consult the Basic form controls and the HTML5 input types documentation."},{"id":10,"title":"00 Index","url":"/interactive-notation/","body":"[in preparation]"},{"id":11,"title":"CSS and SVG","url":"/interactive-notation/css-and-svg.html","body":"Understanding the structure of the SVG The SVG produced by Verovio can be manipulated further. In this tutorial, you are going to use CSS to highlight some content of the output. One key feature of Verovio is that it preserves the structure of the MEI in the SVG output. For example, a chord with two notes encoded in MEI: &lt;chord xml:id=\"c1\"&gt; &lt;note/&gt; &lt;note/&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; will have a the following structure in the SVG: &lt;g class=\"chord\" id=\"c1\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\"/&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\"/&gt; &lt;/g&gt; You will notice that both the tree structure is preserved and that the MEI element names are passed as @class attribute values in the SVG elements, as well as the @xml:id of the MEI element as @id in the SVG. Since SVG can be styled with CSS, it is straightforward to modify the appearance of elements and their contents. Modifying the appearance can be done with a CSS file, or programmatically. Applying CSS to the SVG In the CSS file you need to create rules to be applied to the SVG &lt;g&gt; elements - simply g in CSS - together with the class selector corresponding to the MEI element name. For example, g.tempo modifies MEI &lt;tempo&gt; elements. g.tempo { // ... some CSS properties } To modify the color, you need to change the fill property, and - in some cases - also the color property. The CSS rule will look like: { fill: crimson; color: crimson; } You can also select elements based on their hierarchy. For example, you can select &lt;artic&gt; within &lt;chord&gt; with: g.chord g.artic { } CSS can be animated, for example by making the colors pulsing. You need to specify an animation name with a duration and an iteration count together with corresponding key frames: { animation-name: pulse; animation-duration: 1.0s; animation-iteration-count: infinite; } @keyframes pulse { 0% { fill: orange; } 50% { fill: brown; } 100% { fill: orange; } } CSS can also be used to change the opacity of an element. The opacity value can range from 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (normal default value). Adjusting the style programmatically In applications, it is often useful to modify the CSS programmatically, for example in response to some user interactions. To do so, elements can be accessed by element and class name in the same way as with CSS. For example, for retrieving all rests, you can do: let rests = document.querySelectorAll('g.rest'); You can then loop through the list of rests with: for (let rest of rests) { // you have now access to the rest one by one and can modify their style } To modify the style of an element, you can assign the desired value to the corresponding key. For example, in order to change the color (fill) or a rest (element), you need to do: rest.style.fill = \"dodgerblue\"; Using custom data-* attributes The attributes in the SVG &lt;g&gt; elements corresponding to the MEI elements is not limited to the @class carrying the MEI element name and the MEI @xml:id passed as @id. Verovio also passes MEI @type values as additional @class in the SVG. However, in many cases, applications need to have access at other attribute values. To do so, one can use the svgAdditionalAttribute option to specify which attributes can be made available in the SVG output. For example, for making the note pitch name and the note octave accessible, you can add the following option values to Verovio’s setOptions() method: { svgAdditionalAttribute: [\"note@pname\", \"note@oct\"] } With this option, each g.note element in the SVG will also have a data-pname and a data-oct attribute carrying the original MEI attribute value. For example, a note in MEI and the corresponding SVG element will be: &lt;note pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\"/&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" data-pname=\"c\" data-oct=\"5\"/&gt; This can be used in the query selector to restrict the matches to elements having specific attribute values. For example, for selecting the C5 notes, you would do: let c5s = document.querySelectorAll('g[data-pname=\"c\"][data-oct=\"5\"]'); Accessing MEI attribute values programmatically Custom data-* attributes are straightforward and easy to use with CSS selectors. However, selectors can have some limits, and it is not always possible to know in advance all the attributes that needed in the SVG. Furthermore, if the list of attributes becomes too long, the SVG might become overloaded. In this case, it is possible and preferable to access them programmatically with JavaScript. This can be done through the getElementAttr() toolkit method that gives access to all the MEI attributes of a given element, including attributes not currently supported or not used by Verovio. It takes an xml:id value as the input parameter and returns a JSON object with all the attributes for that element from the MEI encoding. For example, given this MEI: &lt;rest xml:id=\"r123\" dur=\"4\" dots=\"1\"&gt; ```js let attr = tk.getElementAttr(\"r123\"); You can then look at any attributes specifically in the JSON object returned, for example attr.dur for the MEI @dur of the rest: if (attr.dur &amp;&amp; attr.dur == \"1\") { // This is a whole note rest } Full example Open this example in a new window. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt; &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\"&gt; &lt;title&gt;Understanding the structure of the SVG&lt;/title&gt; &lt;!-- A stylesheet for modifying the appearance of the output --&gt; &lt;link href=\"solution.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" /&gt; &lt;!-- Verovio --&gt; &lt;script src=\"https://www.verovio.org/javascript/develop/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized = function () { // This line initializes the Verovio toolkit const tk = new verovio.toolkit(); let zoom = 80; let pageHeight = document.body.clientHeight * 100 / zoom; let pageWidth = document.body.clientWidth * 100 / zoom; options = { pageHeight: pageHeight, pageWidth: pageWidth, scale: zoom, // Add an option to pass note@pname and note@oct as svg @data-* svgAdditionalAttribute: [\"note@pname\", \"note@oct\"] }; tk.setOptions(options); // This line fetches the MEI file we want to render... fetch('https://www.verovio.org/examples/downloads/Schubert_Lindenbaum.mei') // ... then receives the response and \"unpacks\" the MEI from it .then((response) =&gt; response.text()) .then((mei) =&gt; { // ... then we can load the data into Verovio ... tk.loadData(mei); // ... and generate the SVG for the first page let svg = tk.renderToSVG(1); // ... and finally gets the &lt;div&gt; element with the ID we specified, // and sets the content (innerHTML) to the SVG that we just generated. document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = svg; // Get all the rests by selecting &lt;g&gt; with attribute class 'rest' ... let rests = document.querySelectorAll('g.rest'); // ... and change their color by setting their style.fill value for (let rest of rests) { rest.style.fill = \"dodgerblue\"; } // Get all the notes with @pname=\"c\" and @oct=\"5\" and change their color let c5s = document.querySelectorAll('g[data-pname=\"c\"][data-oct=\"5\"]'); for (let c5 of c5s) { c5.style.fill = \"aqua\"; } // Get all the verses ... let verses = document.querySelectorAll('g.verse'); // ... and use the 'getElementAttr()' to retrieve all attributes ... for (let verse of verses) { let attr = tk.getElementAttr(verse.id); // ... and change to color when @n exists and is greater than 1 if (attr.n &amp;&amp; attr.n &gt; 1) verse.style.fill = \"darkcyan\"; } }); } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;!-- The div where we are going to insert the SVG --&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\" /&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;"},{"id":12,"title":"Encoding formats","url":"/interactive-notation/encoding-formats.html","body":"The primary notation encoding format used with Verovio is MEI; however, Verovio supports conversion from a number of other formats, including MusicXML. In this tutorial we will look at how we can get Verovio to convert a compressed MusicXML file to MEI. Saving as MEI When loading a MusicXML file into Verovio, it converts this internally into MEI, which we will be able to export as MEI. To do this, and to make our lives easier, we will use a JavaScript library that helps us save a file. In the &lt;head&gt; section of your file, add the following &lt;script&gt; tag: &lt;script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/FileSaver.js/2.0.0/FileSaver.min.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; To download the MEI file, we will add a button to our page that will trigger a save of the MEI content from Verovio. Just like in previous tutorials, add a “click” handler for a button: document.getElementById(\"saveMEI\").addEventListener(\"click\", (event) =&gt; { let meiContent = tk.getMEI(); var myBlob = new Blob([meiContent], {type: \"application/xml\"}); saveAs(myBlob, \"meifile.mei\"); }); That is, we get the button element (id=\"saveMEI\"), and then tell the button what to do when it is clicked. To get the MEI output we can use the getMEI() method on the toolkit. This will return a formatted string containing the MEI XML output. Then we do a few JavaScript things to get the download to work. First we create a new “Blob”, which is just a wrapper around some arbitrary data. Then we call the saveAs function from the FileSaver.js library we loaded earlier. Compressed MusicXML You may not be aware of it, but there are actually two forms of MusicXML files! Typically, those that end with .xml or .musicxml are “plain” XML files, and we can load them directly. Here we are going to load a “compressed” MusicXML file, normally ending with a .mxl extension. These files are just ZIP files, but have a fixed file-and-folder structure within them. Verovio supports loading these types of files as well, but with a bit of special handling needed. To display this we follow the same methods as loading previous files, except for two main differences: We use response.arrayBuffer() instead of response.text() to read the initial response; We use Verovio’s loadZipDataBuffer toolkit method, instead of the regular loadData method. Wrapping up With Verovio you can easily convert MusicXML files, in both compressed and uncompressed formats, to MEI. There are a number of other formats that Verovio supports as well, but some need to be specially enabled if you wish to use them. Check out the chapter on Input formats in the Verovio book for more details.

It can be used to play an MEI file directly in the browser as demonstrated in this tutorial. Add a MIDI player MIDI playback is not built-in to the web browser, nor available directly in Verovio. This means that we need to add a MIDI player to our page. For this tutorial we are going to use MIDIjs. You need to add a &lt;script&gt; tag with the following src attribute: https://www.midijs.net/lib/midi.js We also need buttons to handle the start and stop playing events. Add them a the top of the body above the notation div: &lt;button id=\"playMIDI\"&gt;Play&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id=\"stopMIDI\"&gt;Stop&lt;/button&gt; You also need to make sure they do something when clicking on them: document.getElementById(\"playMIDI\").addEventListener(\"click\", playMIDIHandler); document.getElementById(\"stopMIDI\").addEventListener(\"click\", stopMIDIHandler); We now need to define what actually happens when the user clicks. That is, defining the playMIDIHandler and stopMIDIHandler functions we just bound to the button event listeners. We can scaffold them with: const playMIDIHandler = function () { // do something to start playing } const stopMIDIHandler = function () { // do something to stop playing } At this stage they do nothing. To start playing, we need to get the MIDI data produced by Verovio and pass it to the player. We will use the Verovio renderToMIDI method that returns a MIDI file encoded as a base64 string, which we can pass to MIDIjs: // Get the MIDI file from the Verovio toolkit let base64midi = tk.renderToMIDI(); // Add the data URL prefixes describing the content let midiString = 'data:audio/midi;base64,' + base64midi; // Pass it to play to MIDIjs MIDIjs.play(midiString); Stop playing is even simpler. You only need to tell MIDIjs to do so: MIDIjs.stop(); The examples above will be followed to write the body of the playMIDIHandler and stopMIDIHandler functions. Highlighting the notes while playing The MIDIjs player provides us with a callback function that gives us the current playback time. We can use this for highlighting the notes as the MIDI file plays! Each time the callback function is called, we can highlight the notes that are currently played, and automatically move to the next page if necessary. You need to start by defining a callback function, similar to the button event we wrote earlier: const midiHightlightingHandler = function (event) { // Do something everytime the callback function is called } You will notice that the function has an event parameter that will give us information about the current event. What we need to use is event.time that indicates the current playing time in seconds. We are going to use this and the Verovio getElementsAtTime method that retrieves all elements being played at a given time in order to obtain the list of notes being played: // Get elements at a time in milliseconds (time from the player is in seconds) let currentElements = tk.getElementsAtTime(event.time * 1000); Now we should check that a page number was set. This is just to ensure we do not end up in an undefined state; for example, if the file is not loaded, or if we asked for elements that do not exist. If the page is 0, something went wrong and we should return: if (currentElements.page == 0) return; We should also check that we are currently rendering the correct page. If not, we should load it first: if (currentElements.page != currentPage) { currentPage = currentElements.page; document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = tk.renderToSVG(currentPage); } To do the highlighting of the notes we are going to use a CSS rule to be defined in the style.css file. A simple way to do it is to add a class playing to be applied to g.notes and that changes the color: g.note.playing { fill: crimson; } Now we can actually highlight the notes. To do so, we are going to loop over the list of notes listed in currentElements and simply add the playing class to them: // Get all notes playing and set the class for (note of currentElements.notes) { let noteElement = document.getElementById(note); if (noteElement) noteElement.classList.add(\"playing\"); } Finally, we need to bind the MIDIjs player with the callback function we have defined. This will be done with: MIDIjs.player_callback = midiHightlightingHandler; This should not work! However, if it does, you will notice that we also need to de-highlight the notes that are not played anymore, otherwise they will stay highlighted. This should be done at the beginning of the midiHightlightingHandler callback function by removing the playing class to the notes that currently have it: // Remove the attribute 'playing' of all notes previously playing let playingNotes = document.querySelectorAll('g.note.playing'); for (let playingNote of playingNotes) playingNote.classList.remove(\"playing\"); The code above needs to be placed within the body of the midiHighlightingHandler function.

This can also be combined with the techniques from the previous tutorials, so you can also highlight or even play back these segments using MIDI. Selecting parts of a score Verovio has a select method available on the toolkit. This method takes a JSON object where you can specify a range of measures in the format “[first]-[last]”. The selection syntax is based on a subset of the measureRange syntax from the Enhancing Music Notation Addressability API. The difference is that Verovio only supports a single measure range. For example: tk.select({measureRange: \"1-10\"}); Once the measures have been selected, calls to render the score to SVG will render only that selected portion. Importantly, it will also reduce the number of “pages” that are available to only the number that are needed to represent the selection.

Verovio supports the selection of variant readings encoded with MEI &lt;app&gt;, containing &lt;lem&gt; and &lt;rdg&gt; elements. Only one variant can be displayed at a time, and this is selected when the file is loaded. By default, Verovio selects the &lt;lem&gt; (or the first &lt;rdg&gt; if no &lt;lem&gt; is provided). In this example we are going to create a basic interface to switch between variants by applying XPath queries for selecting specific readings, and then highlight the editorial markup in different colours. The MEI file we will use for this purpose comes from the Marenzio edition: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marenzio/marenzio.github.io/master/mei/M-04-6/M_04_6_02_Di_nettare_amoroso_ebro_la_mente.mei Selection with an xpath query The first thing we need is a variable to store the XPath queries. This must be an array, but we can start with an empty one, which applies the default behaviour: let appXPath = []; Since Verovio selects the elements to be displayed when loading the file, we need to define a loadFile() function that applies the options, loads the file into Verovio, and renders it: // A function that loads a file function loadFile() { fetch(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marenzio/marenzio.github.io/master/mei/M-04-6/M_04_6_02_Di_nettare_amoroso_ebro_la_mente.mei\") .then((response) =&gt; response.text()) .then((meiXML) =&gt; { tk.setOptions({ pageWidth: document.body.clientWidth, pageHeight: document.body.clientHeight, scale: 50, scaleToPageSize: true, appXPathQuery: appXPath }); tk.loadData(meiXML); notationElement.innerHTML = tk.renderToSVG(currentPage); }); } To load, or reload, the file we can now call the function: loadFile(); In the CSS file we also have defined two rules: g.lem { fill: darkcyan; } g.rdg { fill: crimson; } At this stage, because we have a editorial-markup.css with some rule highlighting for lem and rdg classes, the default &lt;lem&gt; should appear highlighted. Switching between readings To switch between the original and a reading (an English contrafactum text, in this case), we add two buttons, with two handlers that bind to the button event listeners: &lt;button id=\"original\"&gt;Original&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button id=\"contrafactum\"&gt;Contrafactum&lt;/button&gt; const originalHandler = function () { // Do something to render the original } const contrafactumHandler = function () { // Do something to render the contrafactum } document.getElementById(\"original\").addEventListener(\"click\", originalHandler); document.getElementById(\"contrafactum\").addEventListener(\"click\", contrafactumHandler); The file example we are using has some readings encoded as follows: &lt;app&gt; &lt;lem source=\"Italian\"&gt; &lt;verse&gt; &lt;syl&gt;Di&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/lem&gt; &lt;rdg source=\"English\"&gt; &lt;verse&gt; &lt;syl&gt;When&lt;/syl&gt; &lt;/verse&gt; &lt;/rdg&gt; &lt;/app&gt; To select the “English” reading (i.e., in the contrafactumHandler), we can write an xPath query selecting &lt;rdg&gt; elements with the corresponding @source value, in this case “English”, and then reload the file: appXPath = [\"./rdg[@source='English']\"]; loadFile(); For the original, we can reset Verovio by passing in an empty appXPath array: appXPath = []; loadFile(); When switching between the views you will notice that the colour of the text differs between the original &lt;lem&gt; and the English &lt;rdg&gt;.

Its main goal is to develop a library with an internal structure identical to MEI as far as possible. For practical reasons, however, the Verovio library uses a page-based customization of MEI internally. Since the modifications introduced by the customization are very limited, the Verovio library can also be used to render un-customized MEI files. With the page-based customization, the content of the music is encoded in &lt;page&gt; elements that are themselves contained in a &lt;pages&gt; element within &lt;mdiv&gt;. A &lt;page&gt; element contains &lt;system&gt; elements. From there, the encoding is identical to standard MEI. That is, a &lt;system&gt; element will contain &lt;measure&gt; elements or &lt;staff&gt; elements that are both un-customized, depending on whether the music is measured or un-measured. Layout and positioning The idea of a page-based customization is also to make it possible to encode the positioning of elements directly in the content tree. This can be useful where the encoding represents one single source with one image per page. This is typically the case with optical music recognition applications. Verovio supports both positioned elements and automatic layout, which is the default when un-customized MEI files are rendered. The page-based organization is modeled by a MEI customization that defines the structure described above. The ODD file of the customization and the corresponding RNG schema are available from the MEI Incubator. This is still work-in-progress. SVG structure One advantage of SVG rendering over other formats (e.g., images or PDF) is that SVG is rendered natively in all modern web-browsers. Because it is in XML, it also has the advantage that it is well suited to interaction in the browser, since every graphic is an XML element that is easy addressable in the DOM. With Verovio, we also have the advantage that the SVG is organized in such a way that the MEI structure is preserved as much as possible. To give an example, a &lt;note&gt; element with an xml:id attribute in the MEI file will have a corresponding &lt;g&gt; element in the SVG with and class attribute with a value of \"note\" and an id attribute corresponding to the xml:id. This makes interaction with the SVG using JavaScript very easy. The hierarchy of the element is also preserved as shown below. &lt;tuplet xml:id=\"t1\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"&gt; &lt;beam xml:id=\"b1\"&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n1\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\" /&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n2\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"16\" dots=\"1\"/&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n3\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"32\" /&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n4\" pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\" accid=\"s\"/&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;beam xml:id=\"b2\"&gt; &lt;tuplet xml:id=\"t2\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n5\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\" /&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n6\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"16\" dots=\"1\"/&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n7\" pname=\"f\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"32\" accid=\"s\"/&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n8\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\"/&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;g class=\"tuplet\" id=\"t1\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"beam\" id=\"b1\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n1\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n2\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n3\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n4\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"beam\" id=\"b2\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"tuplet\" id=\"t2\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n5\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n6\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n7\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n8\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt;"},{"id":18,"title":"Controlling the SVG output","url":"/advanced-topics/controlling-the-svg-output.html","body":"Units and page dimensions Verovio abstract unit Verovio layout calculation is based on an internal abstract unit. This abstract unit is also used for specifying a few options, such as the page dimensions. By default, the page height is 2970 and the page width is 2100. These are equivalent to the dimension of an A4 page in portrait orientation in tenths of a millimeter. When generating SVG, these units are interpreted as pixels, which means that the default SVG image size is 2970px height by 2100px width. The example below shows an empty page with the default dimensions – and the option --justifyVertically enabled. [SVG file is missing and need to be generated] Page margins (--page-margin-bottom, --page-margin-left, --page-margin-right and --page-margin-top) are also specified in abstract units, with a default value of 50. That is 50px with the SVG image output. Changing the page dimension will increase the amount of music that fits on the page. The example below if the same file rendered with a page height of 3050 and a page width of 2290, a more typical paper size for sheet music than A4.

An MEI unit (or MEI virtual unit) corresponds to half the distance between adjacent staff lines where the interline space is measured from the middle of a staff line. The value of the MEI unit in Verovio is given in abstract units and determines the size of the staff on a page. By default, the MEI unit is 9.0, which means that a staff space is 9 abstract units, or 9px in the SVG image output with the default options. In traditional music engraving, the staff size corresponds to the raster which would be chosen depending of the type and size of score to be engraved. However, in digital environments the size of the notation can be changed on the screen depending on the size and orientation of the screen (i.e., “responsive” environments), and the size of the raster can remain fixed. Adjusting the size of the notation in Verovio is usually changed by adjusting the page size and scaling factors, which are described in the next section. Scaling Using the SVG ViewBox For simple cases where the output SVG image is embedded in a web environment, enabling the --svg-view-box is the simplest way to have the image scaled down to the fit its container. It includes responsive environments when the container size can change interactively. The example below is the default output page with the option --svg-view-box enabled and embedded in a &lt;div&gt; with a with of 210px. As a result, the SVG image is scaled down to fit in it. &lt;div style=\"width: 210px;\"&gt; &lt;!-- SVG image included here --&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Soprano Alto Tenor Bass S A T B A S A T B B C title Empty page Using the Verovio option The SVG output in Verovio can be scaled by using the --scale option. The option value is an integer representing a scaling percentage. It is 100 percent by default. When changing the scale option, Verovio will by default change the size of the output SVG image. For example, with the default page size and a scale option set to 50 percent, the resulting SVG image will have a size of 1485px by 1050px. The same amount of music will be engraved on the page as with the default scale value. In responsive environments, Verovio can be used to create user interfaces where the user can change the magnification (“zoom”). This can be achieved by changing the scale and the page dimensions. Zooming out means increasing the page dimensions and reducing the scale by the same factor, and zooming in the opposite. For example, if the window in which the output of Verovio will be displayed is 1800px by 800px, these can be set as a page height and page width and Verovio will produce an SVG image that fits the window with the default scale value of 100 percent. To implement a zooming out function, for example by a factor 2, the page dimensions have to be changed to 3600 by 1600 and the scale to 50. The output SVG image will then still have a size that fits the window. Scaling to the page size Verovio has a --scale-to-page-size option that simplifies the scaling process described above. Using this option is recommended in responsive environments. The advantage is that does not require the page dimensions to be calculated and changed by the user. With this option, the SVG output image will always have the same size independently from the scale percentage. The scale percentage determines how the rendering is scaled within this image. For example, reducing the scale percentage will increase the amount of music on the page. When this option is enabled, the layout needs to be recalculated when the scale value is changed – see below. The example below shows a file rendered with a page height of 800, a width of 900 and the default scale of 100 percent.

For example, when the ratio of the page dimension are changed, or the margins are changed, then a call to RedoLayout must be made before rendering a page again. It is also important to keep in mind that redoing the layout might yield a different number of pages and that it is important to check the a page still exists with GetPageCount before rendering it. When the --scale-to-page-size option is not enabled on (default), then changing only the scale option does not require the layout to be recalculated before rendering a page again because the amount of music per page and the number of pages will not change. However, when the option --scale-to-page-size is enabled, then the layout recalculation and the page existence check need to happen before rendering a page. SVG optimised for PDF generation The SVG image output in pixel units is well suited to digital environments and rendering on screens. However, in some cases, the SVG will be subsequently converted to a PDF for printing. In such uses, it is recommended to enable the option --mm-output to change the page dimensions to millimeters. In this case, the SVG image produced with the default page height and page width will have a size of 297mm by 210mm. The page margins, with their default value of 50, will have a size of 5mm. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of music on a page, there are two solutions. The first one is to enable the --scale-to-page-size option described above and to adjust the scale value. Because the image produced with the option remains fixed, the page will have a larger or a smaller amount of music on the page depending if the scale option was decreased or increased respectively. The other solution for changing the amount of music on a page is to adjust the MEI unit, which is described below. Adjusting the MEI unit If you want to replicate a print layout with a specific traditional page and staff size, you need to control the size of the staff (or raster). With Verovio, the raster can be adjusted with the --unit option, which adjusts the definition of an MEI unit. One MEI unit (or MEI virtual unit) corresponds to half the distance between adjacent staff lines. In terms of staff size (or raster), it means a staff size of 7.2mm with the --mm-output option enabled. Bear in mind that this size do not factor in the width of the staff line. Because the MEI unit size is measured from the middle of a staff line, the actual staff height will be two half staff line widths more. The table below gives an indication of values for the MEI unit in Verovio corresponding to raster sizes (without staff line width factored in) as found in the literature or some music notation software applications. MEI unit Raster Staff size in mm Example use 11.5 0 9.2 Educational music 9.875 1 7.9   9.25 2 7.4 Piano music 8.75 3 7.0 Single-staff parts 8.125 4 6.5   7.5 5 6.0   6.875 6 5.5 Choral music 6.0 7 4.8   4.625 8 3.7 Full score The example below shows the same file as above with the default A4 page size but with a unit value of 6.0.

The content of the music will laid out on one or more pages. It is possible to adjust the option --breaks to control how the layout is organized, namely where system and page breaks occur. By setting the option --breaks to none, no system and page breaks will occur, and Verovio will output a single system with the entire music content. With this option, the page width will be adjusted (e.g., increased) automatically to ensure that it can contain the entire content. Be aware that this can produce very large files, regarding both the dimension of the SVG image and the actual file size. Content spacing The spacing of the rhythmic values (notes and rests) is adjusted based on their durations, each value taking a bit more space than the next shorter value.

In general, if one of them is increased, the other should be decrease not to have an exaggeratedly expanded - or the other way around. The default values are 0.25 for --spacing-linear and 0.6 for --spacing-non-linear. If you want all measures to have the same width, which means making no spacing difference according to the duration of the notes and rests, the --spacing-non-linear value needs to be set to 1.0.

Their value is given in MEI units and the default value is 12 units. Since a five line staff is 8 units, it means the default spacing between two staves will be one and a half staff height, and an additional equivalent system spacing between two systems. Verovio adds half a staff space above the first staff of a system and below the last one. This is the illustrated below with the default spacing options. When removing the top and bottom page margins (--page-margin-top 0 and --page-margin-bottom 0), there will be only the half staff space above and below. To remove the spacing above and below the staff completely, the staff space has to be removed with --spacing-staff 0. The half staff space above and below the staff means that having music content above or below the staff line does not change vertical positioning when the content fits within that space. Because the default value for --spacing-staff is 12 MEI units, it means that up to 3 staff spaces (e.g., up to a D6 with a G-2 clef) will fit in that space. When the content takes more space than half a staff spacing, then space is added. On a page, it means that the position of the staff will be lowered accordingly. When there is a header or a footer, additional spacing is added between between them and the music content. By default, the spacing is 2.0 MEI units. The value can be adjusted with the options --bottom-margin-pg-header or --top-margin-pg-footer. Vertical justification When producing page-like layouts, it is often desirable to justify the content vertically in order to have the staves distributed on the page in a balance way. By default, no vertical justification is applied, and rendering a page will place all systems at the top of the page. The spacing of the staff and the system will be simply determined by the --spacing-staff and --spacing-system values.

Verovio allows for a more fine-tuned justification with different spacing parameters for staves grouped by a brace or a bracket. The options to adjust are --justification-brace-group, --justification-bracket-group, --justification-staff and --justification-system. Each of these take a parameter from 0.0 to 10.0 acting as a factor on the justification applied. The default value is 1.0 for all of them. Setting one of these options to 0.0 will result in no justification space added between the corresponding staves. For example, the same example as above rendered with --justification-brace-group 0.0 will have a layout where the staff spacing between the staves in the brace groups remains unchanged.

These may include clefs, note heads, time signatures or articulation signs. However, these fonts often have incompatible code points – the internal location within the font that points to a symbol. They are most of the time developed with no common agreement on which code point represents which character. The code point for the G clef symbol in one font may be the code point used for a quarter rest in another, or may be simply undefined. Furthermore, they usually have their own metric and positioning system for specifying what the size of the glyph is and where its baseline is. Because of this, music fonts are difficult to use interchangeably. To address this, the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL) specification has been developed to attempt to harmonize code points across music fonts by specifying code points and symbol sizes for music fonts. SMuFL gives users the ability to reference specific Unicode code points with the understanding that it would represent the same, or similar, symbol across fonts. This presents new opportunities for exploring visual representations of music within a music encoding system without necessarily tying them to a particular font. While previous music encoding systems could not reference font code points without becoming tied to that font for representation, the introduction of SMuFL to music encoding can provide a reference to a particular graphical symbol that should be used to render a given encoding. Verovio follows the SMuFL specification. It means that it is possible to easily change the music font used in Verovio for personalised output. Verovio includes the Leipzig font, its own SMuFL-compliant music font. Leipzig was initially developed by Etienne Darbellay and Jean-François Marti as part of the Wolfgang music notation software. It is SMuFL compliant since version 5.0 and distributed under the SIL Open Font License. Verovio also supports and includes the Bravura font designed by Daniel Spreadbury, and the Gootville and Leland fonts designed by the MuseScore community. Fonts included can be selected by setting the --font option. For example, the Bravura font can be selected with the --font Bravura option on the command-line tool or by adding { font: \"Bravura\" } in the JavaScript toolkit options.

The font is included in the SVG as CSS. The --smufl-text-font allows to change how the font is included. By default, it is simply embedded as a base64 string. This means that the SVG is fully self-contained and does not require network access for the font glyphs to be displayed. The include of the font can also be ignored with none, which can be useful when the font is included seperately in the environment. With linked, the text font will be included in the SVG but with the following CSS import: &lt;style type=\"text/css\"&gt; @import url(\"https://www.verovio.org/javascript/3.13.0/data/Leipzig.css\"); &lt;/style&gt; The version of the font path is based on the Verovio version release number, or is develop for the develop version of the toolkit. When a music glyph is displayed within text and the music font selected is not Leipzig or Bravura, Verovio will also check if the music glyph exists in the selected music font. If not, it will fallback to the Leipzig font. If other text elements include music glyphs that do exist in the selected font, then both Leipzig and the selected font will be included. In other words, the fallback to Leipzig will be enabled only for the text elements displaying a missing music glyphs but not for the others.

In some cases, it might be desirable to disable the automatic detection of dynamic symbols and the use of the music font.

That way, a specific font other than the default font Leipzig or the font set with the --font option can be used by specifying a @fontname value. At this stage, this is supporting only on clef and meterSig. Set a specific fall back Only Bravura and Leipzig have a complete coverage of the glyphs used in Verovio. The --font-fallback parameter option allows to choose between Leipzig (default) or Bravura as the fallback font to be used when the font chosen is missing a glyph. Loading custom fonts The --font-add-custom parameter option allows to load and use an external font not available in the resource directory. The option is repeatable, which means that more than one external font can be loaded. For bindings that use JSON options, the value(s) must be passed in an array. The custom font must be archived in a ZIP file containing the files produced by the font script Verovio provides for extracting relevant information from an SVG font file and the corresponding SMuFL metadata. These files are: The XML file with bounding boxes of the included glyphs. The XML snippets for each glyph The CSS file of the font for text The ZIP filename must correspond to the name of the font. For the JavaScript binding, the ZIP file must be encoded in Base64 and passed as a URL or as a based64 string. Example rendered with --font-fallback Bravura and --font-add-custom GoldenAge.zip (available here) and all fonts loaded with --font-load-all. The elements in olive have a @fontame=\"Petaluma\". The clef in orange is a Bravura fallback.

The option --transpose can be given two types of data: (1) a chromatic interval, or (2) a tonic pitch in the new key with optional direction and octave of transposition added. Transposition by chromatic interval For transposition by chromatic intervals, the format is an optional sign, followed by a chromatic quality followed by a diatonic number of steps. Examples: +M2 = up major second, -d5 = down diminished fifth The direction of the interval, with - indicating down and no sign or a + means up. A special cases is P1 which is a perfect unison, so +P1 and -P1 are equivalent since there is no movement up or down. For the chromatic quality of the interval, P means perfect, M means major, m means minor, d means diminished, A means augmented, dd means doubly diminished (and so on), AA means doubly augmented (and so on). For [PdA] the case of the letter does not matter so [pDa] should be interpreted as equivalent. M and m are case-sensitive (major and minor). The diatonic interval is any (reasonable) positive integer. A unison is 1, a second is 2, and so on. Compound intervals an octave and above can also be represented, such as 8 for an octave, a 9 for a ninth (octave plus a second), 10 for a tenth (octave plus a third), 15 is two octaves, and 16 is two octaves plus a second. Verovio will print an error message if the string option is not formatted correctly, and it will return an error interval which is a very large interval going down. Example interval names: name meaning P1 perfect unison M2 major second up +M2 major second up -M2 major second down m2 minor second up d2 diminished second up dd2 doubly diminished second up A2 augmented second up AA2 doubly augmented second up M3 major third up P4 perfect fourth up d4 diminished fourth up A4 augmented fourth up P8 perfect octave up P15 two perfect octaves up m10 perfect octave plus minor third up Transposition by tonic pitch For transposition by tonic pitch names, the format is made up of an optional direction, a pname and an accid. If no direction is given, then the smallest interval will be chosen. For example if starting from C major and transposing to G major, the calculated interval will be down a perfect fourth, since the G below C is closer than the G above C. When the direction is +, the next higher pitch that matches the new tonic will define the interval. For C major to G major, this is a perfect fifth up. When the direction is -, the next lowest pitch that matches the new tonic will define the interval. For C major to G major, this is a perfect fourth down. The + or - direction can be doubled/tripled/etc. to indicate additional octave transpositions. For example --g from C major means to transpose down an octave and a fourth: The fourth to the G below, and then the octave to the next lower G. Likewise, +++g from C major means to transpose up two octaves and a fifth: A fifth to the G above, then ++ means two octaves above that G. When using a case-insensitive @pname for the tonic of the new key, use ([A-Ga-g]) followed by an optional accid for the new key tonic. This is also case-insensitive: ([Ss]*|[Ff]*). Examples: tonic parameter meaning g transpose current tonic to closest G tonic note (up or down a fourth from current tonic) +g transpose to the next higher G tonic -g transpose down to next lower G tonic ++g transpose to second next higher G tonic --g transpose to second next lower G tonic ff transpose to nearest F-flat -cs transpose to next lower C-sharp ++BF transpose up to second next higher B-flat Illustrated examples Here is a test example music to transpose - note the @key.sig is expected for transposition to work properly: Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} &lt;score&gt; &lt;scoreDef&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;staffDef n=\"1\" lines=\"5\" clef.shape=\"G\" clef.line=\"2\" keysig=\"0\" meter.sym=\"common\"/&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure right=\"end\" n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"/&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"/&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"/&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; Setting transpose: \"M2\" will transpose the music up a major second from C to D: Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Setting transpose: \"-m2\" To go down a minor second from C to B: Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Common intervals: m3 = minor third, M3 = major 3rd, P4 = perfect fourth, P5 = perfect fifth, d5 = diminished fifth, A4 = augmented fourth. It is also possible to give semitone steps, with 1 being one semitone, 2 being two semitones, etc. This method is less precise, and the computer will make an automatic calculating to minimize the number of accidentals in the target key signature. For example transpose: \"1\" will display in D-flat major: Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} This is equivalent to going up a minor second with transpose: \"-m2\": Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} If you need to transpose to C-sharp major, then you cannot use integers, but must use the full musical interval, which in this case is transpose: \"A1\" for an augmented unison: Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} (a1 and A1 are the same, but m2 and M2 are not equivalent). It is also possible to give the tonic note of the new key. For example transpose: \"E\" means to transpose to E major (or minor, since the mode will not be changed). This feature requires that the music contain key information which is not always present in MusicXML data. It can also be incorrect, which may cause problems, so use this option with care in an automatic situation.

If all parts have the same transposition (or no parts have transposition), then use the @pname and @accid as the reference pitch for which an interval will be calculated for the input transposition target tonic. If all parts do not have the same transposition, then choose a part that does not have a transposition from which to extract the key information. If all parts have transpositions, but the transpositions are different, then apply transposition to the key information to get it to sounding pitch for one of those instruments and use this transposed pitch as the basis for the key transposition. The key information may be stored in one of two main locations: staffDef@key.pname/staffDef@key.accid (the most common currently) or keySig@pname/keySig@accid. The staffDef@key.mode/keySig@mode is not needed. This key information must come before the first notes on the staff. keySig may be found as a child of staffDef, or may be found outside of the staffDef (at the start layer) or in scoreDef if it applies to all staves in the score (or the majority of staves in the score?). If there is no key information found before the first notes of the music, print an error warning and do not transpose. Once the original key is known, then the interval necessary for transposition can be calculated. The next step is to identify the closest new tonic’s octave. For extra + or - in the tonic string, add an octave to the interval to calculate the final interval for transposition. At this point the key transposition process becomes equivalent to the interval transposition process."},{"id":22,"title":"Mensural notation","url":"/advanced-topics/mensural-notation.html","body":"Duration alignment One of the unique features of Verovio is to treat mensural notation to be ternary by default. This means that when the notation type on staffDef@notation.type is set to mensural.*, duration will be aligned on a ternary basis by default. Binary alignment can be triggered with @modusmaior=\"2\", @modusminor=\"2\", @tempus=\"2\", or @prolatio=\"2\", as appropriate.

Such instructions allow performers to make informed decisions about the repetition structure during performance. The MEI schema provides the &lt;expansion&gt; element to encode specific versions of a score’s repetition structure. Verovio supports this MEI element with the --expand toolkit option, which generates an unfolded version of the score in the requested output format. This realises the encoded repetitions by copying and/or deleting score elements to match the specified repetition structure. The expansion element is expected to be the first element in a section or ending and must contain descendant expansion, ending, or rdg elements (see guidelines for section). Its @plist attribute may point to its descendant section, ending, rdg, or lem elements to indicate a particular expanded version of that excerpt of the score. See the MEI guidelines for a simple expansion example. Minuet example A typical MEI example (from the Verovio test suite example-expansion-001) is given below containing a straight-forward repetition structure in which the Minuet and the Trio are each repeated once with different endings. As indicated by “Menuett da capo”, the performer is requested to repeat the Minuet after the Trio, but then without repetition, going directly to A2 to terminate the performance.

A1 2. A2 Trio B 1. B1 2. Menuett da capo B2 For an example encoding this minuet with a hierarchical expansion, see below. Exporting an expansionmap For sections that get cloned, Verovio generates predictable xml:ids for all containing elements, appending a -rendX to the existing xml:id, where X is a number starting from 2 for the first repetition of a given element. Thus, xml:id=\"A-rend3\" would refer to the third occurence (or the second repetition) of section \"A\". To track the relationship between the original score and a unfolded repeats, Verovio provides access to the expansionmap. This JSON object contains key-value pairs with unique keys for each xml:id in the encoding (both the original and the unfolded elements) and values containing a list of related (original and unfolded) elements, e.g. [\"A\", \"A-rend2\", \"A-rend3\"]. For more information on the expansionmap, see Output formats. Example with re-ordered sections The following example has a slightly more complex default expansion structure that requires section A to be rendered three times, each time choosing a different ending.

format('woff2'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; } Hierarchical expansion structure The elements referred to in the expansion@plist may themselves be expansion elements situated in descendent section elements. The expansion structure of the above Minuet example could also be encoded in a hierarchical way, i.e., with separate sub-sections for Minuet and Trio, each hosting their own expansion element embedded, to which then the top-level expansion elements refer to (for the complete MEI encoding, see Verovio test suite example-expansion-001-hierarchical): &lt;section xml:id=\"all\"&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-default\" plist=\"#exp-menuett-default #exp-trio-default #exp-menuett-minimal\"/&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-minimal\" plist=\"#exp-menuett-minimal #exp-trio-minimal #exp-menuett-minimal\"/&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-maximal\" plist=\"#exp-menuett-default #exp-trio-default #exp-menuett-default\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Menuett\"&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-menuett-default\" plist=\"#A #A1 #A #A2\"/&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-menuett-minimal\" plist=\"#A #A2\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"A\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"A1\" n=\"1.\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"A2\" n=\"2.\"/&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Trio\"&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-trio-default\" plist=\"#B #B1 #B #B2\"/&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"exp-trio-minimal\" plist=\"#B #B2\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"B\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"B1\" n=\"1.\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"B2\" n=\"2.\"/&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/section&gt; A complex but typical example is the chained Waltz structure of An der schönen blauen Donau by Johann Strauss II. (To open a public-domain encoding in mei-friend, please click here.) In turn, each waltz contains a set of expansion elements, each defining a repetition structure performed within the history of the Vienna New Year’s Concert series. The higher-level expansion element then refers to these waltz-level expansions. The beginning of the section structure of the first two waltzes including the respective expansion structure looks like this: &lt;section xml:id=\"Donauwalzer\"&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Longest_Version_Krauss\" plist=\"#Introduktion #Walzer-1-withRep-woDalSegno #Walzer-2-withRep-withDalSegno ...\" /&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Shorter_Version_Boskovsky\" plist=\"#Introduktion #Walzer-1-woRep-woDalSegno #Walzer-2-woRep-withDalSegno ...\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Introduktion\"&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Andantino\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Tempo-di-Valse\"/&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-1\"&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Walzer-1-withRep-woDalSegno\" plist=\"#Walzer-1-A #Walzer-1-B-Upbeat #Walzer-1-B #Walzer-1-B-ending1 #Walzer-1-B #Walzer-1-B-Fine\"/&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Walzer-1-woRep-woDalSegno\" plist=\"#Walzer-1-A #Walzer-1-B-Upbeat #Walzer-1-B #Walzer-1-B-Fine\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-1-A\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-1-B-Upbeat\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-1-B\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"Walzer-1-B-ending1\" n=\"1.\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"Walzer-1-B-dalSegno\" n=\"2.\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"Walzer-1-B-Fine\" n=\"Fine\"/&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-2\"&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Walzer-2-withRep-withDalSegno\" plist=\"#Walzer-2-A-Upbeat #Walzer-2-A #Walzer-2-A-ending1 #Walzer-2-A #Walzer-2-A-ending2 #Walzer-2-B #Walzer-2-A #Walzer-2-A-Fine\"/&gt; &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Walzer-2-woRep-withDalSegno\" plist=\"#Walzer-2-A-Upbeat #Walzer-2-A #Walzer-2-A-ending2 #Walzer-2-B #Walzer-2-A #Walzer-2-A-Fine\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-2-A-Upbeat\"/&gt; &lt;section xml:id=\"Walzer-2-A\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"Walzer-2-A-ending1\" n=\"1.\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"Walzer-2-A-ending2\" n=\"2.\"/&gt; &lt;ending xml:id=\"Walzer-2-A-Fine\" n=\"Fine\"/&gt; &lt;/section&gt; ... The following expansion element refers to the longest and most typical realisation of this piece in the history of the Vienna New Year’s Concert series, as first conducted by Clemens Krauss: &lt;expansion xml:id=\"Longest_Version_Krauss\" plist=\"#Introduktion #Walzer-1-withRep-woDalSegno #Walzer-2-withRep-withDalSegno #Walzer-3-withRep1-withRep2-woDalSegno #Walzer-4-withRep1-withRep2-woDalSegno #Walzer-5-withRep-woDalSegno #Coda\"/&gt;"},{"id":24,"title":"00 Index","url":"/toolkit-reference/","body":""},{"id":25,"title":"Input formats","url":"/toolkit-reference/input-formats.html","body":"When data is loaded into Verovio with no input format specifies, it tries to detect it based on the initial content of the data. MEI is assume to be the default format if auto detection fails. In such cases, the format can be given explicitly with the option --input-from (or -f). MEI The native input format for Verovio is MEI. Verovio supports MEI as input format from MEI 2013 onwards. From Verovio 2.x.x, the plan is to have even version numbers for Verovio releases using a stable version of MEI, and odd version numbers for releases using a development version of MEI. It means that once MEI 5.0 will be released, Verovio will move to version 4.x.x. Older versions of MEI are still supported by newer versions of Verovio. When loading MEI data into Verovio and outputting MEI, elements that are not supported by Verovio will be ignored. This means that they are not loaded into memory and will not be preserved in the MEI output. This includes the element themselves, but also any descendant they might have. A warning will be given in the console.

Humdrum Humdrum data is an analytic music code for transcribing fully polyphonic textures. Humdrum syntax presents notes of the score in strict time sequence. Each data row represents all notes sounding or events occurring at the same time, and each column traces the melodic line of the individual parts. More information about the syntax is available on the Humdrum website. Examples The following example from Mozart’s piano sonata in F major, K1 280 (K6 189e), mvmt. 1, is generated dynamically within this page using the JavaScript form of Verovio, inputting the Humdrum data that follows.

MusicXML Verovio has two converters for importing MusicXML data. The first one directly converts MusicXML into MEI. The second one first converts to Humdrum and then converts the Humdrum to MEI. By default, the first importer is used. It is also the one triggered when the value xml is passed to the --input-from option. Compressed MusicXML files Verovio supports MusicXML compressed (MXL) files. It only loads basic single-file MusicXML MXL files containing the index file (META-INF/container.xml) and the MusicXML file, with the extension .xml. The input process searches for the META-INF/container.xml file from which the filename of the MusicXML file is extracted. The filename extracted is the first ./rootfile@full-path listed in /container/rootfiles. Input of MXL files is auto detected and the xml value does not have to be passed to --input-format. However, when using the JavaScript toolkit, you need to make sure your data is an ArrayBuffer or a base64 string, and use loadZipDataBuffer() or loadZipDataBase64() respectively to load it instead loadData(). Here is an example using the JavaScript Fetch API, loading the file as an ArrayBuffer: fetch( mxlUrl ) .then( response =&gt; response.arrayBuffer() ) .then( data =&gt; { vrvToolkit.loadZipDataBuffer( data ) // Do anything else you want with the file here } ).catch( e =&gt; { console.log( e ); } ); Importing MusicXML via Humdrum The MusicXML import via Humdrum is available only for Verovio builds where Humdrum support has been enabled specifically at build time. For the JavaScript toolkit, this is not the default and it is important to make sure that the appropriate build is being used. See the related section for more information about this. With the command-line tool and the Python toolkit, Humdrum support is enabled by default. With Verovio builds that support Humdrum, the MusicXML import via Humdrum can be triggered by setting the --input-from option to musicxml-hum. For example: verovio -f musicxml-hum -t hum file.xml The MusicXML import via Humdrum can itself be made the default MusicXML importer with the build option MUSICXML_DEFAULT_HUMDRUM. See the command-line section for more information on how to change build options. With this, MusicXML files will be loaded via the Humdrum importer without having to specify musicxml-hum for the option --input-from. The direct importer can still be used by passing the value xml to --input-from. Plaine and Easie The Plaine &amp; Easie Code is a library standard that enables entering music incipits in modern or mensural notation. It is mostly used by the Répertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) for inventorying the music incipits of the manuscripts. More information about the syntax is available on the IAML website. Plaine and Easie input in Verovio is a text file (or string) with a list of the following @key:value lines: @clef – the initial clef @keysig – the initial key signature @timesig – the initial time signature @data – the incipit content From version 3.7, the content can be structured as a JSON object with a clef, keysig, timesig and data key. Verovio will auto detect both as Plaine &amp; Easie format. Internaly, text files with @key:value lines are converted into a JSON object. The structure of this input format is not part of the PAE specification but only a convention put in place for Verovio Examples Beams and tuplets Text file input @clef:G-2 @keysig:xFCGD @timesig:3/8 @data:'6B/{8B+(6B''E'B)}({AFD})/{6.E3G},8B-/({6'EGF})({FAG})({GEB})/4F6- JSON input { \"clef\": \"G-2\", \"keysig\": \"xFCGD\", \"timesig\": \"3/8\", \"data\": \"'6B/{8B+(6B''E'B)}({AFD})/{6.E3G},8B-/({6'EGF})({FAG})({GEB})/4F6-\" } Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Measure rests and key and time signature changes @clef:G-2 @keysig:xF @timesig:3/8 @data:=25//=5//$xFCG @c 2-4.-'8E/{6AGFE}{8A''C}'B''4D{6C'B}/{''DC'BA}{''8EA} Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Clef changes @clef:F-4 @keysig:bB @timesig:c @data:,6{FA'CF}%G-2 {''6CEA'''C}%F-4 {,6FB'DF}%G-2 {''6DFA'''D}/ Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Trills and fermata @clef:C-4 @keysig:xFC @timesig:c/ @data:,{8.A6A}/'4.Dt8D4.Ct8D/{8.E6C},8(A)'E4DtE/{8.Ft3GE}8(D)-2-/ Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Ties @clef:G-2 @keysig:xFCG @timesig:3/8 @data:''8-{CD+}/{DC'B}/{xAB''F+}/{FED}/{CGB+}/{BAG+}/{GFE}/ Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Grace notes (acciaccaturas) @clef:G-2 @keysig:bBE @timesig:2/4 @data:''{8.F6D'8B}6-''F/{8.F6E8C}6-E/{8DC}{'8B''gC'gBgAgB''6FE}/2D Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Grace notes (appoggiaturas) @clef:F-4 @keysig:xF @timesig:c @data:qq,3{DnF'D}r/2Fqq,3{DnF'D}r2Aqq3,{DF'D}r/1bB,qq3{EG'C}r/1A// Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Rhythmic patterns @clef:C-1 @keysig:xFCGD @timesig:c @data:'2-4.-8D/{EG}6.3{BA}{GF}{ED}{EF}{GA}{GF}/4E Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Abbreviated writing @clef:G-2 @keysig: @timesig:3/4 @data:'6!{GGCC}!f{GCGC}/i/i/ Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} PAE Validation The toolkit can be used to validate Plaine &amp; Easie input data with the ValidatePAE or ValidatePAEFile methods. The methods load the PAE data passed as a string or from a file respectively. They both return a stringified JSON object with validation error or warning messages. The JSON object can contain one or more validation messages. When a global input error is encountered (e.g, data is missing in the input), a single object is returned. Otherwise, the object is structured with keys corresponding to the JSON input keys (clef, keysig, timesig and data). Each key can have one single validation message, except for data that contains an array of one or more messages. Only keys for which a validation message is given will exist in the validation object. In non-pendantic mode, syntax problems are marked as warning as long as parsing can continue. Each validation message is structured as follow: { \"column\": 0, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 1, \"text\": \"A description of the validation problem\", \"type\": \"error\" } Description of the values: The column indicates the position where the problem occurs in the input string. It is always 0 for clef, keysig and timesig. It can be -1 in data when no position can be indicated. The row is always 0. The type can be error or warning. The code corresponds to a numeric error code that can be used to map the errors into another system and (for example) to translate the messages. Whenever the error message contains a string interpolation %s, then the json message also contains a value key with the value to be used for the interpolation. Here is an example of invalid input data and the object returned by the validation call: { \"clef\": \"GG2\", \"keysig\": \"bB\", \"data\": \"=1/4-''DC'tB/''tCC\" } { \"clef\": { \"column\": 0, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 43, \"text\": \"Unexpected second character in clef sign\", \"type\": \"warning\" }, \"data\": [ { \"column\": 10, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 17, \"text\": \"Invalid t not after a note\", \"type\": \"warning\" }, { \"column\": 15, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 17, \"text\": \"Invalid t not after a note\", \"type\": \"warning\" } ] } ABC Abc is a text-based music notation system originally designed for use with folk and traditional tunes and used throughout the web. You can find the documentation on the ABC notation website. Examples Let’s start with a simple little tune. X: 99 T:Short tune C:K.

Rettinghaus Verovio takes several information fields into account, e.g. the reference number X, the tune title T, the meter M, the unit note length L, the key K. As you can see, Verovio prints the header as expected by default. You may suppress this behaviour with the --header none option. Now let’s add a literal tempo as well as some grace notes and chord symbols. Dynamics are also very important! Note that chord symbols are put above the melody. X: 99 T:Short tune C:K.

It can be imported into Verovio as of version 4.4. CMME files can be imported with -f cmme.xml but are also auto-detected. A CMME file is imported as an MEI mensural file with one single mdiv/score. Sections in CMME are imported as distinct section elements within the score. Everything in imported as mensural notation, including sections marked as Plainchant in CMME since there is no difference in the way the music is encoded in those sections. Where there is less voices in a section than in the rest of the score, empty and invisible staff elements &lt;staff visibility=\"false\"/&gt; are added to the section. The initial staffDef elements have no @clef.* and no @keyisg and these are given in the layer instead. Every staffDef contains a mensur indicating that all level of divisions are binary by default. MEI header The GeneralData element of the CMME file is used to populate the MEI header. It uses: The Title as title The Section as title@type=\"subordinate\" The Composer as composer Durations The CMME import forces the use of the --duration-equivalence option to minima when importing a CMME file. A warning is shown if the option was previously different - which is the case by default. This could potentially have side effects for subsequent calls since it is not set back to its original value. Proportions Proportions in CMME can be encoded as Proportion element, or as TempoChange within Mensuration. Encoding a proportion as a tempo change is arguably not the proper way to do it, but as a matter of fact, it is a used practice the importer needs to deal with. The importer tries to disentangle proportions and tempo changes. One complication is that proportions and tempo changes in CMME act differently. Proportions are cumulated with the previous ones, whereas tempo changes are not. Ideally proportions encoded in a mensur indications that are actual tempo changes should be ignored in the conversion because they do not represent a proportion in the notation. Furthermore, when converting the imported data to CMN, this will yield measure content that hardly makes sense since tuplets will be used to represent the proportions. However, when a proportion encoded in a mensur indication is a real proportion, it must be taken into account and preserved. The importer ignores, if possible, the proportions inserted in the mensuration signs indicating a tempo change. This is done on the basis of the presence of an identical proportion for all voices. When tempo change proportions are occurring at all voices and with an identical Num and Den, they are preserved as an MEI proportion with a @type=\"cmme_tempo_change\". Verovio ignores when performing that alignment of the data, including when converting to CMN. When the proportion is not identical in all voices, it has to be preserved and taken into account for the alignment of the data. We can here distinguish two cases. The first is when the tempo change does not occur in all voices. In this case, it quite likely corresponds to a true proportion. It is preserved as an MEI proportion but with a @type=\"reset\" to indicate that it should not be cumulated with a previous one - which is the default behavior of Verovio. The second case is where all voices have a proportion, but it differs. In this case, there is no straightforward way of knowing which proportion is a tempo change, and which is a mixture of the two. The conversion will maintained an MEI proportion with @type=\"reset\" at all voices. Even though the conversion result will be properly aligned in mensural MEI, it will yield a combination of corresponding tuplets when converted into CMN that will not be fully satisfactory. The best thing to do would be to correct the CMME files and to remove the tempo changes, or to separate the proportions and the tempo changes. Finally, a CMME Proportion will converted to MEI proportion with no @type, impliying that the proportion has to be cumulated with a previous one. Coloration and color change Coloration in CMME is encoded with Colored on Note, and is converted to MEI @colored . The CMME ColorChange (i.e., the change of the color of the ink) is converted by applying the color (non-black) to note@color and rest@color. The possible colors are black (assumed to be the default and not encoded), red, yellow, green or blue."},{"id":26,"title":"Output formats","url":"/toolkit-reference/output-formats.html","body":"SVG For more information about the SVG output in Verovio, see the Internal structure and the Controlling the SVG output sections in the previous chapter. Font limitation Firefox on Linux (Ubuntu), uses “DejaVu Serif” as default font, which can cause some text layout problems when displaying the SVG files generated with Verovio. MEI With its MEI output, Verovio can serve as a converter to MEI. This can be useful for converting data from another input format supported by Verovio (e.g., MusicXML, ABC) to MEI. It can also be used to upgrade files encoded in an older version of MEI to the one supported by the version of Verovio that being used. Another typical use-case where outputting MEI from Verovio can be desirable is for transposing content. When converting other formats to MEI, it is important to keep in mind that the output produced by Verovio will only include the MEI features (elements and attributes) currently supported by the Verovio version being used. It is also important to remember that the MEI produced by Verovio is only one way to express things in MEI and that MEI will often offer other valid and recommendable ways to represent the same things. Choosing between them depends on the goal being pursued. It is possible that Verovio is the appropriate solution but not necessary. When converting from an older version of MEI, it is important to remember that Verovio will not perform any upgrade of the data encoded in the MEI header, with the exception of the MEI version. This means that using Verovio for upgrading MEI data is probably appropriate only for encodings that feature a very basic header and is not recommended with rich ones. It is recommended to check what has changed in MEI for the header between the versions. In any case, it is strongly recommended to check the header by validating the output files produced by Verovio. Regarding the content, Verovio will upgrade only the features that used to be supported in the previous version. See the section on MEI in the Input formats in the previous section for more detail about what is upgraded. Unsupported elements and attributes When loading MEI data into Verovio and outputting MEI, the following is to expect regarding MEI elements and attributes that are currently not supported by Verovio. Because elements that are not supported by Verovio are ignored and are not loaded into memory, they will not be preserved in the MEI output. This includes the element themselves, but also any descendant they might have. As described in the section about the Input formats, a warning will appear in the console about these. There is one exception with the &lt;annot&gt; elements for which all the content will be preserved, including MEI element descendants that are not supported elsewhere in Verovio. Regarding attributes, Verovio will preserve in the output all attributes, including the one that are not supported or that have not relevance for the rendering. Analytical markup When loading MEI data into Verovio, some analytical markup is converted into standard markup. The attributes that are converted are: @fermata @tie For example: Original data &lt;note t=\"i\" xml:id=\"n1\"/&gt; &lt;note t=\"t\" xml:id=\"n2\"/&gt; Output data &lt;tie startid=\"#n1\" endid=\"#n2\"/&gt; Original data &lt;mRest fermata=\"above\" xml:id=\"mr1\"/&gt; Output data &lt;fermata startid=\"#mr1\" place=\"above\"/&gt; By default, the analytical markup is not preserve in the MEI output. It can be with the option --preserve-analytical-markup. Articulations Articulations in MEI can be encoded with multiple values within a @artic attribute. Verovio implementation is based on single valued @artic attributes. When loading MEI data, multiple valued attributes are transformed into corresponding single valued ones by duplicating the &lt;artic&gt; element. This remain as such in the MEI output. For example: Original data &lt;artic artic=\"marc ten\" place=\"above\"/&gt; Output data &lt;artic artic=\"marc\" place=\"above\"/&gt; &lt;artic artic=\"ten\" place=\"above\"/&gt; Page-based MEI The MEI page-based model is not part of MEI. It was put in place for the development of Verovio and can still change in the future. It will be documented as input format once it is stabilized. MIDI Verovio provides a basic MIDI output feature that can be used from the command-line tool or from the JavaScript toolkit. The MIDI output can be written to a file for further processing or for building application with MIDI playback, including in online environments. However, since MIDI is not supported in web-browsers in a standard way, an additional player will be required in such cases. When a file is loaded in the toolkit only to render a MIDI file, then setting the --breaks option to none is more efficient because it will avoid the unecessary step of calculating the page layout of the document. The command-line version of the toolkit does this automatically. The MIDI output takes into account: Tempo indication (@midi.bpm) provided in the first scoreDef and in tempo elements. The sounding accidental values provided by @accid.ges on notes and accid. The sounding octave values provided by @oct.ges on note. Transposing instrument information provided by @trans.semi on staffDef. Tie elements referring to notes with @startid and @endid. Verovio uses the Midifile library for generating the MIDI output. Usage With the command-line tool, for generating a MIDI file with the default options, you need to do: verovio -t midi -o output.midi input-file.mei With the JavaScript toolkit, the MIDI output is available through the renderToMIDI() method. This returns a base64-coded MIDI file as string, which can be passed to a player or made available for download. Timemap The timemap is an array of JSON objects, with each entry having these keys: tstamp: this is the time in millisecond from the start of the music to the start of the current event (real time) qstamp: the time in quarter notes from the start of the music to the start of the current event entry (score time) tempo: when the tempo changes the new tempo will be given for the current event. Also the tempo changes are only allowed to occur at the starts of measures in the current code for creating MIDI files, and this is the same limitation for the timemap file. The tempo and qstamp values can be used to re-calculate a new set of tstamp values if the tempo changes. on: This is an array of note ids that start at the current event time. This list will not be given if there are no note ons at the current event. off: This is an array of note ids that end at the current event time. This list will not be given if there are no note offs at the current event. When a file is loaded in the toolkit only to render the timemap file, then setting the --breaks option to none is more efficient because it will avoid the unecessary step of calculating the page layout of the document. The command-line version of the toolkit does this automatically. Usage With the command-line tool, for generating a timemap JSON with the default options, you need to do: verovio -t timemap -o output.json input-file.mei Examples Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a

is generated when the xml:id of an expansion element is passed to Verovio with the --expand option. The expansionmap represents the relationship between the original score parts and the repeated (expanded, unfolded) sections created through the expansion process. While expanding, Verovio generates new, predictable xml:ids for all expanded elements (section, ending, rdg, lem), appending a -rendX to each xml:id, with X being the number of occurrences, starting from 2 for the first repetition of a given element. Thus, xml:id=\"A-rend3\" would refer to the third occurence (or the second repetition) of element \"A\". The keys in the expansionmap JSON object are the xml:ids of expanded elements in the score (both original and unfolded). The values contain lists of related (original and unfolded) elements, e.g. [\"A\", \"A-rend2\", \"A-rend3\"]. The original score element (e.g., \"A\") is always the first value in the list. Usage To generate an expansionmap JSON with the default options on the command line: verovio -t expansionmap --expand expansion-default -o output.json expansion-001.mei Examples Engraved by Verovio 6.0.0-9dac18a g.ending, g.fing, g.reh, g.tempo {font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum {font-style:italic;}g.label {font-weight:normal;} ellipse, path, polygon, polyline, rect {stroke:currentColor} Menuett A 1.

With this in hand, you can convert MusicXML to Humdrum from the command-line with: verovio -f musicxml-hum -t hum file.xml If the MusicXML importer via Humdrum is the default, you can simply do: verovio -t hum file.xml"},{"id":27,"title":"Toolkit methods","url":"/toolkit-reference/toolkit-methods.html","body":"This section documents the methods available from the Verovio toolkit. The methods are public methods of the C++ vrv::Toolkit class. They are all available in the Python and JavaScript bindings, unless specified otherwise. For examples, all the methods reading a file or writing to a file are not available in the JavaScript version of the toolkit. The names of the methods is also indentical across the different versions of the toolkit except for the capitalisation. The original C++ method names are UpperCamelCased in C++ but lowerCamelCased in the Python and JavaScript bindings. This is only to make the bindings follow more idiomatic capitalisation. For the methods taking parameters as stringified JSON objects (or returning one), the objects are not stringified in the JavaScript version of the toolkit. That is, a JSON object is passed or returned as is. The same applied for the Python toolkit where the object is passed or returned as a Python dictionary. ConvertHumdrumToHumdrum Filter Humdrum data.

It has been tested on several operating systems and architectures. This section describes how to build and install the command-line version of the toolkit from the command-line or using some of the most popular IDEs. There are currently no pre-built binaries of the command-line toolkit available except for Homebrew on macOS. However, building it is very straight-forward. Homebrew on macOS For macOS users using Homebrew, the command-line version can be installed with: brew install verovio This also installs the resources and you will be ready to go. You can also install the latest development source with: brew install verovio --HEAD Building on macOS or Linux To build the command-line tool, you need CMake to be installed on your machine as well as a compiler supporting C++17. The commands to build are the following: mkdir -p build cd build cmake ../cmake make You can increase the building speed by using the -j option when running make that specifies the number of jobs to be run in parallel: make -j 8 The generates a verovio binary within ./build. You can run Verovio from there or install it. Installing it means copying the executable and the resource files to directories which paths are globally accessible. You simply need to run: sudo make install If you do not install it and run it from ./build or from another directory, you need to use the -r option to set the appropriate resource directory. The parameter of the -r option has to be a path to the ./data folder of the codebase. To see the current default resource path, look for the “resource path” section in the full help output. You should see something like this: verovio -h full ... -r, --resource-path &lt;s&gt; Path to the directory with Verovio resources (default: \"/usr/local/share/verovio\") Keep in mind that if you have installed, you should not run another version without re-installing it or using the -r options to point to a non-default path, because otherwise the resources installed can be invalid. A typical problem is missing font glyphs that a newer version needs but that are not in the older version of the resources. (Until version 2.6.0, the cmake command was cmake . and not cmake ../cmake.) Basic usage To seeing the basic command-line options, run: verovio --help To see all command-line options, run: verovio -h full For typesetting an MEI file with the default options, you need to do: verovio -o output.svg Hummel_Concerto_for_trumpet.mei If you use a version locally that is not installed, do not forget to add the -r parameter: ./verovio -r ../data -o output.svg Hummel_Concerto_for_trumpet.mei Additional building options By default, the executable is not stripped. To strip it during the installation do sudo make install/strip To build Verovio without Plaine and Easy support, run: cmake ../cmake -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=ON To allow PAE support again, you must run the command cmake ../cmake -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=OFF since running cmake ../cmake will not clear the state of the define variable. The other building options are: NO_ABC_SUPPORT for the ABC importer to be turned on/off NO_MXL_SUPPORT for the compressed MusicXML importer to be turned on/off NO_HUMDRUM_SUPPORT for the Humdrum importer to be turned on/off MUSICXML_DEFAULT_HUMDRUM to use the MusicXML Humdrum importer by default instead of the direct MusicXML importer BUILD_AS_LIBRARY for Verovio to be built as dynamic shared library instead of a command-line executable Uninstall a previous version If you have installed Verovio with Homebrew, run: brew uninstall verovio To uninstall a previously installed version of Verovio from the system, run: rm -f /usr/local/bin/verovio rm -rf /usr/local/share/verovio Troubleshooting Occasionally there are problems with updates necessary to the Makefile when compiling a new version of Verovio with make. It may be necessary to clear out the automatically generated cmake files and regenerate them. To do that, run: rm -rf CMakeFiles CMakeCache.txt Makefile cmake_install.cmake Or, when using CMake 3.24 or later, you can simply run: cd tools cmake ../cmake --fresh Windows 10 To build Verovio on Windows 10 from the command-line, you will need to have Microsoft C++ Build Tools and make installed on your computer. Run the following commands from the x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS (with administrator privileges): cd &lt;sourceCode&gt;/tools cmake ../cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" nmake nmake install After the installation, add &lt;sourceCode&gt;/tools to the PATH of your system. When running the commands, the resource path should be provided explicitly with the following option: -r \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Verovio/share/verovio\" Xcode For macOS users, there is also an Xcode project in the Verovio root directory. By default, humdrum support is turned off in Xcode. To turn in on, you need to use the Verovio-Humdrum building scheme. Visual Studio Install CMake Go into the tools folder of Verovio Execute cmake ../cmake -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=ON (add -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 for a x64 solution) Open the resulting Verovio.sln with Visual Studio and build it from there Visual Studio Code Verovio contains simple predefined build tasks in the tasks.json file. You can build Verovio by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B / ⇧⌘B or running Run Build Task from the global Terminal menu."},{"id":33,"title":"JavaScript and WebAssembly","url":"/installing-or-building-from-sources/javascript-and-webassembly.html","body":"Pre-build versions The verovio.org GitHub repository provides compiled versions of the JavaScript toolkit. The toolkit is available in three options. The recommended version is one built as WebAssembly because it is the fastest and supported by all recent browsers. To use it, the file you need to include is: verovio-toolkit-wasm.js If you need Humdrum support, the file to include is: verovio-toolkit-hum.js If you need to have support for old browsers, there is an asm.js version available. This version is obsolete and is not recommended for new projects. The file to include is: verovio-toolkit.js A build for the development version of the verovio-toolkit-wasm.js is available through CI, as well as for each release for the Humdrum and the legacy asm.js version. The latest release is always available from: https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js The latest development version is available from: https://www.verovio.org/javascript/develop/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js Previous releases are available from their corresponding directory, e.g.: https://www.verovio.org/javascript/2.7.1/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js For instructions on a basic usage of the JavaScript version of the toolkit, see the Getting started section of the Tutorial 1: First steps chapter. NPM The latest stable version is available via NPM registry. The version distributed via NPM it the WebAssembly build. It can be installed with: npm install verovio The homepage of the Verovio package includes documentation on how to use it. Basic usage with NPM const verovio = require('verovio'); const fs = require('fs'); /* Wait for verovio to load */ verovio.module.onRuntimeInitialized = function () { // create the toolkit instance const vrvToolkit = new verovio.toolkit(); // read the MEI file mei = fs.readFileSync('hello.mei'); // load the MEI data as string into the toolkit vrvToolkit.loadData(mei.toString()); // render the fist page as SVG svg = vrvToolkit.renderToSVG(1, {}); // save the SVG into a file fs.writeFileSync('hello.svg', svg); } Usage with ESM Since version 3.11.0 there is an ESM compatible version of the npm package with a modularized build of the Verovio module. This is because we need to wait for the asynchronous module to be ready for usage, and this is now Promise based instead of using the onRuntimeInitialized callback function. Use .mjs as file extension when using this directly in Node.js or set \"type\": \"module\" in your package.json. import createVerovioModule from 'verovio/wasm'; import { VerovioToolkit } from 'verovio/esm'; import fs from 'node:fs'; createVerovioModule().then(VerovioModule =&gt; { const verovioToolkit = new VerovioToolkit(VerovioModule); const score = fs.readFileSync('hello.mei').toString(); verovioToolkit.loadData(score); const data = verovioToolkit.renderToSVG(1, {}); console.log(data); }); This is the recommended way to use Verovio when creating a website or web app with bundlers like webpack or Vite or when using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js. Usage with CommonJS Alternatively this package also exports a version compatible with CommonJS const createVerovioModule = require('verovio/wasm'); const { VerovioToolkit } = require('verovio/esm'); Humdrum support Since version 3.11.0 the NPM package provides an additional module with Humdrum support: import createVerovioModule from 'verovio/wasm-hum'; Building the toolkit To build the JavaScript toolkit you need to have the Emscripten compiler installed on your machine. You also need CMake. You need to run: cd emscripten ./buildToolkit -H The toolkit will be written to: ./emscripten/build/verovio-toolkit.js Building without -H will include the Humdrum support, which increases the size of the toolkit by about one third. In that case, the output will be written to verovio-toolkit-hum.js. If you are building with another option set than previously, or if you want to regenerate the makefiles, add the option -M."},{"id":34,"title":"Python","url":"/installing-or-building-from-sources/python.html","body":"Pre-build versions Pre-build versions of the Python version of the toolkit are available through PyPi for every release since version 3.1.0. The Python versions for which a pre-build is provided are 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13. The platforms supported are macOS, Linux with manylinux for x86-64, Win-32 and Win-amd64. The latest release can be installed with: pip install verovio A previous version can be installed with: pip install verovio==3.2.0 For all platforms or architectures for which a pre-build version is not available in the PyPi repository, a source distribution is available. It can be installed with the same command as above. This will automatically trigger the compilation of the package. Basic usage of the toolkit Once installed, the Verovio tookit module can be imported with import verovio You can then create an instance of the toolkit and load data. For example: tk = verovio.toolkit() tk.loadFile(\"path-to-mei-file\") tk.getPageCount() Once loaded, the data can be rendered to a string: svg_string = tk.renderToSVG(1) It can also be rendered to a file: tk.renderToSVGFile( \"page.svg\", 1 ) Setting the resource path The Python wheels include the resource directory and it is normally resolved by default when using the module. However, in some cases, it might be not found. This will typically raise some errors about the Bravura and the Leipzig default fonts being not found. In such cases, the resource path must be set explicitly. It should still be possible to use the resources included in the module, with: import verovio import os tk = verovio.toolkit(False); tk.setResourcePath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(verovio.__file__),\"data\")); Setting options The options are set on the toolkit instance. For the Python version of the toolkit, the options (and all other parameters or values return by a function that are a JSON string in the C++ version) are a Python Dictionary. For example, the following code will change the dimensions of the page and redo the layout for the previously loaded data: options = { \"pageHeight\": 2100, \"pageWidth\": 2950, \"scale\": 25 } tk.setOptions(options) tk.redoLayout() tk.renderToSVGFile( \"page-scaled.svg\", 1 ) Building the toolkit To build the Python toolkit you need to have swig and swig-python installed on your machine (see SWIG) and the Python distutils package. Version 4.0 or newer of SWIG is recommended but older versions should work too. To install SWIG in macOS using Homebrew, type the command brew install swig. The Python toolkit can be built with CMake, You need at least version 3.13 of CMake because it uses the option -B introduced in that version of CMake. The steps are: cd bindings cmake ../cmake -B python -DBUILD_AS_PYTHON=ON cd python make -j8 If you want to enable or disable other specific options, you can do: cmake ../cmake -B python -DBUILD_AS_PYTHON=ON -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=ON By default, Python 3 is used. If you want to use a specific version of Python, you can do: cmake ../cmake -B python -DBUILD_AS_PYTHON=ON -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.9 Installation with CMake has not be tested yet Building the toolkit without CMake The toolkit can be build without CMake. However, SWIG is still needed. It needs to be built from from the root directory of the repository content. To build it in-place, run: python setup.py build_ext --inplace If you want to install it, run: python setup.py build_ext sudo python setup.py install For building it with one or more specific options (e.g., without Plaine &amp; Easie support), run: python setup.py build_ext --inplace --define NO_PAE_SUPPORT Building with pip You can build and install with pip directly from a remote repository with: pip install --global-option=build_ext git+https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio You may specify the branch, commit hash, or tag name after an @ at the end of the Git url. If you have a local copy of the repository just run: pip install &lt;path_to_local_repo&gt; Building a Python wheel locally You can build a Python wheel locally with: python setup.py bdist For a source distribution, do: python setup.py sdist In both cases, the wheel will be written to the ./dist directory. Resources for versions built locally When using a version built locally, you usually have to specify the path to the Verovio resources. To do so, you can do import verovio tk = verovio.toolkit(False) tk.setResourcePath(\"path-to-resource-dir\") Alternatively, you can set it before you create the instance of the toolkit import verovio verovio.setDefaultResourcePath(\"path-to-resource-dir\") tk = verovio.toolkit()"},{"id":35,"title":"Java and Android","url":"/installing-or-building-from-sources/java-and-android.html","body":"Java To build the Java toolkit you need to have swig and swig-java installed on your machine (see SWIG) as well as Maven. You need to run: cd bindings/java mvn package mvn package Note the mvn package command needs to be run twice. You can test it with the MEI and PAE examples. For example – replace X.X.X with the appropriate version number: cd example-mei javac -cp .:../target/VerovioToolkit-X.X.X.jar main.java java -cp .:../target/VerovioToolkit-X.X.X.jar main This should write an output.svg file in the current directory. The PAE example will write the SVG to the standard output. See this issue for SVG output problems on non US Ubuntu installations. Android The simplest way to use Verovio in Android is to use the Java bindings provided by Verovio. You can have it generated and compiled directly in Android Studio. The sample application repository provides a complete example on how to use it, with Verovio included as a submodule in external/verovio. You need swig to be installed on your machine.

Once this is done, Verovio is available in Swift with: import VerovioToolkit var toolkit = VerovioToolkit() Note that the constructor in the Swift binding does not set the resource path. You need to do it explicitly by calling toolkit.setResourcePath. The nice thing, however, is that the Swift binding provides a VerovioResources.bundle with the Verovio resources. So setting the resources will look like: let bundle = VerovioResources.bundle if let resourceURL = bundle.url(forResource: \"data\", withExtension: nil) { let resourcePath = resourceURL.deletingLastPathComponent().path let _ = toolkit.setResourcePath(resourcePath + \"/data\") } else { print(\"Could not find resource URL for 'data'\") } Loading some data and rendering will work with the usual methods of the toolkit: let res = toolkit.loadData(data) let svg = toolkit.renderToSVG(1, false) Objective-C with CocoaPods The simplest way to use Verovio in Objective-C is to use CocoaPods to install Verovio by adding it to your Podfile: platform :ios, '16.0' use_frameworks! target 'MyApp' do pod 'Verovio', :git =&gt; 'https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio.git', :branch =&gt; 'master' end Then, run the following command: pod install To use Verovio in your iOS project import #import &lt;Verovio/Verovio-umbrella.h&gt; Then you can create an Objective-C wrapper with the following VerovioToolkitWrapper.h/mm files (here with a few sample methods): #import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt; NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN @interface VerovioToolkitWrapper : NSObject - (instancetype)init; - (NSInteger)getPageCount; - (NSString *)getVersion; - (BOOL)loadData:(NSString *)data; - (void)redoLayout; - (NSString *)renderToSVG:(NSInteger)pageNo; - (void)setOptions:(nullable NSString *)jsonOptions; @end NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_END #import \"VerovioToolkitWrapper.h\" // Include the umbrella header #import &lt;Verovio/Verovio-umbrella.h&gt; // Include the C++ Verovio header #include &lt;verovio/toolkit.h&gt; @implementation VerovioToolkitWrapper { std::unique_ptr&lt;vrv::Toolkit&gt; toolkit; } - (instancetype)init { self = [super init]; if (self) { NSBundle *verovioBundle = [NSBundle bundleWithIdentifier:@\"digital.rism.VerovioFramework\"]; //NSLog(@\"Bundle path: %@\", verovioBundle.bundlePath); NSString *resourcePath = [verovioBundle URLsForResourcesWithExtension:@\"xml\" subdirectory:@\"data\"] .firstObject.URLByDeletingLastPathComponent.path; // Obviously it would be good to check that verovioBundle and resourcePath are not nil toolkit = std::make_unique&lt;vrv::Toolkit&gt;(false); toolkit-&gt;SetResourcePath([resourcePath cStringUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding]); } return self; } - (NSInteger)getPageCount { return toolkit-&gt;GetPageCount(); } - (NSString *)getVersion { std::string version = toolkit-&gt;GetVersion(); return [NSString stringWithUTF8String:version.c_str()]; } - (BOOL)loadData:(NSString *)data { std::string input = [data UTF8String]; return toolkit-&gt;LoadData(input); } - (NSString *)renderToSVG:(NSInteger)pageNo { std::string svg = toolkit-&gt;RenderToSVG((int)pageNo); return [NSString stringWithUTF8String:svg.c_str()]; } - (void)redoLayout { toolkit-&gt;RedoLayout(); } - (void)setOptions:(nullable NSString *)jsonOptions { std::string options = jsonOptions ?

The modifications include: AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: true AllowShortLoopsOnASingleLine: true ColumnLimit: 120 ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine: true PointerAlignment: Right The simplest way to fullfil the Verovio coding style is to use a clang-format tool and to apply the style defined in the .clang-format file available in the project root directory. Short if-statements should be as single line only with single boolean evaluation. How to install clang-format on macOS An easy way to install clang-format on macOS computers is to use Hombrew. Type this command in the terminal to install: brew install clang-format How to install clang-format on Ubuntu On Ubuntu clang-format is available in the universe repository. You can install it easily with the command: sudo apt install clang-format Running clang-format Please make sure you use at least version 10.0 To use clang-format to adjust a single file: clang-format -style=file -i some-directory/some-file.cpp The -style=file option instructs clang-format to search for the .clang-format configuration file (recursively in some parent directory). The -i option is used to alter the file “in-place”. If you don’t give the -i option, a fomatted copy of the file will be sent to standard output. Includes and forward declarations Includes in the header files must list first the system includes followed by the Verovio includes, if any, and then the includes for the libraries included in Verovio.

Forward declaration have to be ordered alphabetically: class DeviceContext; class Layer; class StaffAlignment; class Syl; class TimeSpanningInterface; In the implementation files, the first include in always the include of the corresponding header file, followed by the system includes and then the other Verovio includes with libraries at the end too, if any, also ordered alphabetically: #include \"att.h\" //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include \"object.h\" #include \"vrv.h\" //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include \"pugixml.hpp\" Null and boolean The null pointer value should be written as NULL. Boolean values should be written as true and false. Integer data types Integer numbers should be int, or char but only when this is clearly appropropriate. The use of short is to be avoided unless there are some particular reasons to use it. Variables and class members should not be unsigned numbers unless strictly necessary. We use int and not size_t, even when working with C++ standard containers. Values such as the one returned by std::vector::size() need to be cast to int when assigned or compared to variables. However, in cases where the scope is limited to local operations on the container and the use of int would yield a warning, size_t is acceptable. We avoid the use of auto and prefer explicit typing. Loop variable scope and increment Variables should be made local to loops when possible (C99). for (int i = 0; i &lt; limit; ++i) {} They should preferably be pre-incremented, especially when not an int or alike. Class, method and member names All class names must be in upper CamelCase. The internal capitalization follows the MEI one: class Measure; class ScoreDef; class StaffDef; All method names must also be in upper CamelCase: void Measure::AddStaff(Staff *staff) {} All member names must be in lower camelCase. Instance members must be prefixed with m_ and class (static) members with s_: class Glyph { public: /** An instance member */ int m_unitsPerEm; /** A static member */ static std::string s_systemPath; }; In the class declaration, the methods are declared first, and then the member variables. For both, the declaration order is public, protected, and private. Use of this The convention for the pointer this is to use it for method calls and not to use it for member access because these are prefixed with m_. As it stands, the codebase is not consistently following this convention Comments Comments for describing methods can be grouped using ///@{ and ///@} delimiters together with the @name indication: /** * @name Add children to an editorial element. */ ///@{ void AddFloatingElement(FloatingElement *child); void AddLayerElement(LayerElement *child); void AddTextElement(TextElement *child); ///@} LibMEI The code for the attribute classes of Verovio are generated from the MEI schema using a modified version of LibMEI available here. See the section Generate code with LibMEI for detailed information on how to modify and generate this code. The attribute classes generated from the MEI schema provide all the members for the element classes of Verovio. They are implemented via multiple inheritance in element classes. The element classes corresponding to the MEI elements are not generated by LibMEI but are implemented explicitly in Verovio. They all inherit from the Object class (of the vrv namespace) or from a Object child class. They can inherit from various interfaces used for the rendering. All the MEI member are defined through the inheritance of generated attribute classes, either grouped as interfaces or individually. For example, the MEI &lt;note&gt; is implemented as a Note class that inherit from Object through LayerElement. It also inherit from the StemmedDrawingInterface that holds data used for the rendering. Its MEI members are defined through the DurationInterface and PitchInterface that regroup common functionnalities for durational and pitched MEI elements respectively plus some additional individual attribute classes. The inheritance should always list Object (or the Object child class) first, followed by the rendering interfaces, followed by the attribute class interfaces, followed by the individual attribute classes, each of them ordered alphabetically: class Note : public LayerElement, public StemmedDrawingInterface, public DurationInterface, public PitchInterface, public AttColoration, public AttGraced, public AttStems, public AttTiepresent In the implementation, the same order must be followed, for the constructor calls and for the registration of the interfaces and individual attribute classes: Note::Note() : LayerElement(\"note-\") , StemmedDrawingInterface() , DurationInterface() , PitchInterface() , AttColoration() , AttGraced() , AttStems() , AttTiepresent() { RegisterInterface(DurationInterface::GetAttClasses(), DurationInterface::IsInterface()); RegisterInterface(PitchInterface::GetAttClasses(), PitchInterface::IsInterface()); RegisterAttClass(ATT_COLORATION); RegisterAttClass(ATT_GRACED); RegisterAttClass(ATT_STEMS); RegisterAttClass(ATT_TIEPRESENT); Reset(); } Resetting the attributes is required and follows the same order void Note::Reset() { LayerElement::Reset(); StemmedDrawingInterface::Reset(); DurationInterface::Reset(); PitchInterface::Reset(); ResetColoration(); ResetGraced(); ResetStems(); ResetTiepresent(); // ... }"},{"id":41,"title":"Contributing workflow","url":"/contributing/workflow.html","body":"When contributing to Verovio there are a few steps you can take to help make your contribution easy to understand and evaluate. Verovio uses the GitHub issue tracker and pull requests mechanism to organize these contributions. These steps are: Provide an short example MEI encoding that demonstrates a bug or a new feature that can be included in our test suite. You can use the Verovio Editor to create your example. This is described in more detail below. Open an issue describing the problem or the new feature, and attach your short example. This provides our developer community with an opportunity to provide feedback on the problem, and determine the appropriate course of action. If you can also provide the solution to the problem by modifying the Verovio source code, then that will speed up the process of getting your issue fixed! If you are a first-time contributor, then please make sure you have read the contributing guidelines. When you are ready, open a Pull Request, making sure to reference the open issue that it solves. Adding examples to the test-suite When adding examples to the test-suite, you should keep in mind the following points: The example should be as minimal as possible, ideally one or two measures and without un-related MEI / notation features The example has to be valid MEI (4.0 or 5.0-dev) The header should follow the test-suite style The XML should be indented with 3-spaces It is not mandatory to have an @xml:id on all MEI elements The file name should follow the test-suite style Example header Example MEI header for a test-suite example: &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Slur position with cross-staff&lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;persName role=\"editor\"&gt;Laurent Pugin&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"encoder\"&gt;Craig Sapp&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"2021-01-06\"&gt;2021-01-06&lt;/date&gt; &lt;pubPlace&gt; &lt;ref target=\"https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/issues/1898\" /&gt; &lt;/pubPlace&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;notesStmt&gt; &lt;annot&gt;Slurs with cross-staff should be place identically as in normal situations.&lt;/annot&gt; &lt;/notesStmt&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;encodingDesc&gt; &lt;appInfo&gt; &lt;application version=\"3.1.0\" label=\"2\"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Verovio&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/application&gt; &lt;/appInfo&gt; &lt;/encodingDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; File names The test suite examples are grouped by element name, with a very few exceptions. There is a corresponding folder name in the test suite folder. A test-suite example should be saved in the folder corresponding to the MEI element it targets. File names also use the element name and are numbered using the three digits (-001.mei) pattern. Additional options In some cases, a test suite example can require specific Verovio options to be set for it to make sense. For instance, it can require a specific layout or spacing parameter, or a specific font. The options can be set in the header of the MEI file as JSON object encoded as CDATA in the &lt;extMeta&gt; tag. For example, setting the Bravura font can be triggered by including the following tag in the header of the test suite example: &lt;extMeta&gt;&lt;![CDATA[{ \"font\": \"Bravura\" }]]&gt;&lt;/extMeta&gt; The additional options set in the MEI header are taken into account in both the test-suite page and the test-suite evaluation performed by the GitHub Actions. However, they currently remain ignored in the Verovio Editor. What to expect with an open issue When opening an issue, you should be prepared to help shepherd it through the process of getting fixed. If it is a problem with the software itself and you do not know how to fix it, you can still help with testing any potential fixes. You can also help by improving documentation about the new feature by contributing to the Verovio book, as appropriate. Please do not open an issue unless you are willing to help, in some way, solve it. If you open an issue and someone provides a fix that requires no further changes, please respond! A “thank-you” and a note to say that it fixed the problem is always appreciated. You can also close the issue so that we know it has been addressed. Sometimes an issue may be open for several years. These issues may be particularly complex, or may have been partially but not fully fixed. They usually have a discussion attached with sample encodings. Sometimes these issues have actually been fixed later, but as part of a separate issue. If you open an issue that happens to be fixed later, you can help us by leaving a note on your issue and closing it yourself. If you are a software developer and can provide a solution, you should mention this in your issue. For new contributors it is useful to open issues prior to opening pull requests. Sometimes a change cannot be accepted, so opening an issue first gives an opportunity for the more experienced members of the community to provide feedback before you invest a lot of time in it. The quickest and easiest way to get help is to reach out on the #verovio channel in the MEI Community’s Slack chat. If you are not already a member, you can join. Issues that have a code contribution attached, and which have active participation from the reporter, are typically addressed first and fixed sooner. This is largely due to the community-driven nature of the project, recognizing that the more experienced developers have their own set of priorities. If you can provide a fix, even if it is not 100% correct, then it is easier to review your contribution and provide feedback than it is for someone else to code something from the ground up. If Verovio is a critically important part of your project, and you need dedicated help to make changes and contributions, the Verovio project accepts some sponsorship arrangements.

It can be adapted to generate code in any language. For Verovio, it is used to generate C++ code. The code generated with LibMEI is included in the Verovio repository in the ./libmei directory and the LibMEI repository does not need to be cloned for building Verovio. Whenever the MEI schema is modified, this code needs to be re-generated in order to integrate these changes. However, since Verovio implements only a small subset of the MEI schema, this really needs to be done only for the changes in the schema that touch features supported by Verovio. This means that the code within the ./libmei/dist directory should never be edited by hand because any change will be overwritten by the LibMEI output when the code generated from the schema needs to be updated and LibMEI is run again. Generating LibMEI You can regenerate the LibMEI code with a compiled ODD as input. Go to the ./libmei directory and run: python tools/parseschema2.py -c config.yml ./mei/mei-verovio_compiled.odd Customization Verovio currently uses an MEI customization that has added or modified a few elements. It is defined in the file ./libmei/mei/develop/mei-verovio.xml. If you want to make changes to it, you can make them there. You will need to regenerate the ODD file ./libmei/mei/develop/mei-verovio_compiled.odd. This can be done with the Edirom MEI Garage. Alternatively, you can also use the MEI command line script. To do so, you need to create a clone of the MEI repository, copy your customization file (e.g., mei-verovio.xml) into it and do: ant init ant -lib lib/saxon/saxon9he.jar -Dcustomization.path=mei-verovio.xml The ODD file will be written to ./dist/schemata/mei-verovio_compiled.odd, which you can use as new input file for LibMEI."},{"id":43,"title":"Adding SMuFL glyphs","url":"/contributing/adding-smufl-glyphs.html","body":"All SMuFL glyphs used by Verovio have to be available in the Leipzig font. For adding support for a new SMuFL glyph, the steps are: Add the glyph to the Leipzig font file Generate the Leipzig in various format and the metadata with the script available in Leipzig repository Add the glyph to the list of supported glyph in the XML list and re-generate the fonts. Make sure you always add glyphs only in the Leipzig font. Because conflict solving is quickly very when adding a glyph (in particular with the binary font files), make sure you always pull the latest version of the font file branch before starting your work and do not wait too long before making a PR. If changes have been made in between, you will need to add your glyphs again. When making a PR, always add an image (e.g., screenshot of FontForge) showing the glyphs. Adding the glyph to the Leipzig font file The file to modify is ./Leipzig.sfd and should be edited with FontForge. Very often it is possible to copy another existing glyph as basis for the new glyph. Leipzig is visually lighter and thinner than Bravura and new glyphs have to follow this design choice. Do not simply copy glyphs from Bravura. Make sure the font is valid by running “Element =&gt; “Find Problems…”. Once the new glyph(s) has/have been added, you also need to change the version number in the font info (menu “Element” =&gt; “Font Info” and then tab “PS Names” in fields “Version” and “Copyright” and tab “FONTLOG” where you also need to add a comment together with the version number. The file can be saved. Generate other font formats and the metadata Once the ./Leipzig.sfd has been modify and saved, you have to run the ./generate_font.py script that will generate different font formats and the metadata. You are now ready to make a PR to the Leipzig repository. Add the glyph to the list of supported glyph in the XML list and re-generate the fonts Once the PR to the Leipzig repository has been approved and merged, the new glyphs have to be added to the Verovio codebase. The first thing to do is to add them to the list of glyphs supported by Verovio. Open the file ./fonts/supported.xml and uncomment the glyph(s) you added to Leipzig. The XML file is then used to extract the glyphs supported by Verovio. To do so, you need to copy to ./fonts/Leipzig the new Leipzig files: Leipzig.woff2 Leipzig.ttf Leipzig.svg leipzig_metadata.json The glyphs will be extracted from the SVG font by running the script ./fonts/generate_all.sh (from ./fonts/). This will extract all the glyphs from the SVG font file and calculate the their bounding boxes. When this is done you will see your glyphs in ./data/ and in ./include/vrv/smufl.h. The CSS font files will also be updated. When using a custom FontForge binary (e.g. latest AppImage) the specific location needs to be provided to generate.py via the --fontforge &lt;path-to-fontforge-binary&gt; command line argument. When using generate_all.sh, all command line arguments are passed on to the python scripts. Example: ./generate_all.sh --fontforge /mnt/linux-data/henry/Apps/FontForge-2023-01-01-a1dad3e-x86_64.AppImage"}]
