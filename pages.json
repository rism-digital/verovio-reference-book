[{"id":0,"title":"About this book","url":"/introduction/","body":"This book is intended to serve as a reference guide for how to work with Verovio, and is meant for users of all skill levels. The book is a collaborative work that brings together inputs from the many contributors to the Verovio projects under the editorial leadership of the RISM Digital Center team. This initial chapter gives an introduction to Verovio and the history of the project as well as an overview on how to use it. The following two chapters provides a number of tutorials, starting at the very basic and ending at advanced topics in notation. By the end of these you should have a very good understanding of how to use Verovio in its different forms, and how you can start to integrate it into your own work. The chapter on advanced-topics provides some more in-depths explanation of specifics of Verovio. The last chapters provides a reference for the operations and options available. They also cover how to build and install Verovio, including from the source code, and how to contribute to the active development of Verovio.

They each have their own internal structure and file formats. Furthermore, the music notation rendering engines of music notation editors are not very modular and cannot easily be used or integrated into other applications. Besides music notation editors, some music notation rendering engines are also available as command-line tools. These are easier to integrate than desktop applications, however with occasionally quite significant dependencies and requirements that limit the contexts in which their use is possible. This is the case for LilyPond, a very popular and powerful typesetting engine Such tools have been used for many years within the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) community for engraving scores encoded in MEI. Using them, however, meant converting the MEI to another encoding scheme that could be used as input format for the engraving tool. Whichever solution was used to do this, it remained clearly suboptimal. MEI users willing to benefit from all the strengths of MEI were facing the problem of not being able to render their data properly. Converting a music encoding format to another one is known to become quickly problematic. It is particularly true when converting from MEI markup that is rich and detailed, a feature that distinguishes MEI from other encoding schemes. With a conversion step, it is likely that not all the information will be preserved in the rendering, or at least only in cumbersome ways and with sometimes quite limited results. At that time, by about thirty years after the initial development of music notation software applications, the digital domain had significantly changed with the advent of the online world. For music notation, this translated into new possibilities but also new challenges to be faced. While most music notation engraving tools target PDF, this format is clearly not the ideal one in web-based environments. It can be published online, but some web browsers still require a dedicated viewer plugin to be installed for this to be possible. They yield inconsistent viewing and document browsing experiences, which is far from ideal. To embed PDF files directly in web pages code, they need to be converted to images, which creates an overhead and additional complications in the publication process, with often poor results in the display quality. Early stages In 2013, the RISM Digital Center launched the development of Verovio for rendering the music incipits or the RISM project. The main idea behind the development of Verovio was to implement a tool that could render the RISM music incipits directly but also to support MEI natively. That is, without having MEI converted to another format, either explicitly or internally in the software application used for rendering. With Verovio, the MEI markup is parsed and rendered as notation with a single tool and in one step. One of the reasons for choosing to implement a library from scratch rather than modifying an existing library was that it will allow to operate on a memory representation of MEI, which will make it significantly easier to render complex MEI features in the long run. Previous experience has indeed shown that modifying an existing solution can be very quick to develop at the beginning, but that the development curve eventually reaches a plateau. Another idea behind the development of Verovio was to have a tool that would be easy to use in web environments. Instead of targeting PDF output, Verovio uses the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format developed and maintained by the W3C. The advantage of SVG over other output formats, and Postscript and PDF in particular, is that it can easily be used in a web-based environment because it is rendered natively in most modern web browsers with no plug-in required. In addition, since SVG is a vector format, the output can also be used for high-quality printing, which means that it offers the best of both digital and paper-based worlds. With the same goal in mind, Verovio was designed to be light and fast and has no external dependencies, making it very flexible and easy to use or integrate into digital environments. Interacting with music encoding Today, partly in response to the development of MIR applications, rendering of music notation can be necessary in very different contexts, for example within standalone desktop applications, in server-side web application scenarios, or directly in a web browser. Music notation might need to be rendered for displaying search results or for visualising analysis outputs. Another example is score-following applications, where the passage currently played needs to be displayed and possibly highlighted. These are different use-cases of interactive applications where music notation plays a key role, including many cases where the notation itself has to be an interactive component. Several design features of the Verovio library make it highly suitable for interactive music notation applications. It is a software library that can run in a wide range of environments (and not a full software application) and it is light and fast. The JavaScript version of Verovio is particularly promising because it provides a fast in-browser music MEI typesetting engine that can easily be integrated into web-based applications. This setup makes it possible to design ground-breaking web applications where the MEI encoding is rendered on the fly. In such designs we can rethink the interface and avoid mimicking page output. We can instead adjust the layout dynamically to the screen of the device employed by the user. The layout can be calculated to fill the size of the screen, or interactively changed according to a zoom level adjusted by the user. This opens up new responsive web-interfaces to be designed and developed based on dynamic music notation reflow. This works particularly well with SVG, especially since it is now supported by all modern web browsers. However innovative the dynamic layout of music notation may be, it remains a very basic interaction. Verovio aims to go further and to produce a graphic output that can then be the foundation for more complex interactions. Because SVG is XML, it has an advantage over raster image formats in that every graphical element is addressable. This feature makes it intrinsically well suited for interaction, and this is also true for music notation. In a web environment, the addressability can be used for highlighting graphical elements such as notes or any other music symbols. One additional characteristic of SVG is that its XML tree can be structured as desired, and an innovative design feature of Verovio was to go further in the structuring of the output by leveraging this characteristic. Since Verovio implements the MEI structure internally, this key feature of SVG made it possible to preserve the MEI structure in the design of the SVG output in Verovio. Preserving the MEI structure in the SVG output is a considerable overhead in the rendering process but makes it a unique feature of Verovio. As a result, Verovio output in SVG is not the end of a unidirectional rendering process. Quite on the contrary, it should instead be seen as an intermediate layer standing between the MEI encoding and its rendering that can act as the cornerstone for a bi-directional interaction: from the encoding to the notation, but also from the notation to the encoding through the user interface. Design principles The basis for interactivity offered by MEI coupled with Verovio follows some important design principles. First for all, the principle of availability and discoverability. That is, all the content (e.g., all the MEI editorial variants) is available. Alternative text can be made discoverable, for example with CSS highlighting. It also follows the design principle of scalability. Verovio is light and fast. It can run on small devices, but it also supports large files in higher resource environments. They are also some technical principles that are followed as far as possible. They include reusability and durability. By providing only the interaction foundation and not making any assumption in interface design, especially with a software library that has no dependency, reusability is undeniably maximised. So is the durability, although durability is hard to predict in software development, particularly for digital humanities projects which have slow development cycles in comparison with the development of the technology itself. Reducing dependencies as much as possible is one way to increase durability. In the case of MEI rendering, keeping the rendering engine separate from larger applications that will use it is another way. In terms of editions and interface design, there is much still to invent. This will need to be done hand in hand with the development of MEI. It is obvious that merely imitating printed output in a digital environment will not be satisfactory. Most effort should be spent on developing the added value that digital environments can offer. Parallel with the development of the online world is the appearance of new devices, such as tablets with wireless network access. They offer new possibilities in terms of digital access and change the manner and location in which digital content can be read. Developing these possibilities will not preclude the co-existence of printed editions, which have and will continue to retain their own added value. The challenge now is neither to replicate nor to supplant existing media or applications, but to expand horizons by exploring new ways of conceiving the information to which we have access, and MEI and Verovio are a decisive and exciting step in this direction."},{"id":2,"title":"Use-case scenarios","url":"/introduction/use-cases.html","body":"Architecture possibilities Verovio is a C++ codebase that can be compiled and wrapped into different programming languages and integrated into various environments and several use-cases can be imagined for the Verovio toolkit. First of all, it can be built and used as a standalone command-line tool. This option is well suited to scripting environments and applications. The command-line tool can be used to render music notation files into SVG or into MIDI files. These files can be embedded in HTML files with everything happening on the server side. Verovio can also be used to convert data (e.g., MusicXML or Humdrum) to MEI. Typical use cases would be : generate SVG and MIDI from MEI documents or other supported formats, generate MEI documents from other supported formats (e.g., convert files). Resulting SVG or MEI documents can then be embedded in a HTML page or used as such. The JavaScript toolkit makes it possible to generate SVG and MIDI directly in the browser. It is easy to set up and platform independent. Interaction with the user can then be handled with basic JavaScript or CSS. An example of how to handle events is given in the tutorial. It is also possible to process the MEI via XSLT in the browser before loading it into Verovio. Both approaches can be combined: one may choose to process the MEI and to generate the SVG server side for better performance, and then handle interactions client side with JavaScript and CSS. Application examples Interactive applications in which the MEI and Verovio pair is being used are very diverse. In this section, we list some example application uses-cases based on this pair and where interaction is an important component. Most of the projects selected are research projects or research tools, but not only. Critical editions The Digital Interactive Mozart Edition (DIME) is a joint project of the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation and the Packard Humanities Institute in California. It is one example project in the field of digital critical editions that takes advantage of very rich and powerful markup possibilities offered by the MEI schema. In this context, interaction capabilities open completely new and welcome perspectives in interface design. Critical editions traditionally encompass extremely dense information networks that have to be laid out on paper with all the associated bi-dimensional constraints. Variant display is notoriously cumbersome and the information often has to be scattered between various part of the books (e.g., the critical notes referring to the music scores listed at the end of a volume). Genetic editing Genetic editing is still an exploratory field in music. In this context, MEI is in active development under the lead of the Beethovens Werkstatt project. In genetic editing, time is a key dimension to be taken into account in the representation of differences. The differences in genetic editing represent different stages of writing for which it is not always possible to determine clearly their scope, their order in time or even their content because it is not always readable. This yields potentially very complex and large datasets for which the music notation content cannot be visualised as a whole. Only subsets of the data can here be reasonably visualised at a time, and interaction is the perfect approach for allowing highlighting, selection and navigation in the data. Early music Thanks to the overall simple structure of its notation (e.g., monophony for chant), early music has often been at the forefront of development of digital projects. Nonetheless, most of the time they remained isolated because of the need to develop dedicated encoding schemes and tools. The Measuring Polyphony project, a repository of digital encoding of late medieval polyphony at Brandeis University, is a good example of a change. The same ecosystem as for CWMN is used here. The MEI modularity allows for precise representation of the mensural notation, and the development of MEI and Verovio allow, for the first time, early music notation to be properly encoded accurately regarding the ternary and binary durations in the music. Interaction perspectives can be seen for linking original notation and modern transcriptions, which remains desirable for non-expert audiences. Audio alignment Alignment of scores with audio recordings, also known as score following, is a typical music information retrieval task. The main challenge is to generate the alignment data taking into account the fact that performances vary in tempo and that sections of the score can be repeated in some performances. The Freischütz Digital is an example project where the alignment data is stored in MEI with synchronisation information at the measure level generated for multiple recordings. The playback is synchronised with Verovio using measure xml:id for following the score or jumping anywhere in it. Clicking anywhere on the score can conversely be used to jump to the corresponding place in the recording. In the case of this project, because the MEI data also contains mapping of the measures with their corresponding zone in the facsimile image of the handwritten manuscript, the same synchronisation can be realized with it. Music notation editing Interaction with music notation can take the form of data editing, either in a WYSIWYG manner or by allowing music encoding text editing. The Neon.js project for neume notation is an example of the former approach. It is currently going in-depth refactoring for switching from a previous ad-hoc rendering solution to Verovio rendering. The later editing approach is implemented in the Verovio Humdrum Viewer (VHV) project where editing of the encoding (Humdrum or MEI) is updated on the fly. The same setup has recently been integrated into Atom as a plugin package, MEI-tools-atom. In both the VHV and the Atom package, the rendered notation can be clicked to navigate in the encoding. Music addressability In music literature or in music practice, addressing music notation generally relies on movement names and measure numbers, and additionally voice or instrument names and beat numbers when necessary. However, there is no formalised concept behind this practical approach. Addressing music notation in the digital world has been recently the focus of the Enhancing Music Notation Addressability (EMA) project at the University of Maryland. The goal of the project is to develop a generic system for expressing addresses in music notation documents. In order to evaluate it, the project developed a web service with an API for addressing MEI documents, the Open MEI Addressability Service (OMAS). The Verovio rendering is used to display a selection. Conversely, the rendered music notation can serve as the basis for selecting interactively a zone to be transformed into an address in the music notation data. Visualisation Visualisation is an important field of research and experimentation in digital humanities. With digital publications and digital devices, interactivity significantly increases the visualisation possibilities. For example, the visualisation scope or perspective can change dynamically following the choice of the user or the content of the data. With dynamic music notation rendering, it is possible to augment it with additional visualisation layers as demonstrated by the performance analysis and re-synthesis of piano music PerformScore project at the Music and Audio Computing Lab. A player featuring score following for multiple performances to be selected by the user as seen with the Freichütz Digital project is enhanced here with the visualisation of additional characteristics of the performance being played. They include tempo and dynamic changes but also the intensity of individual notes through colour and opacity adjustment. Louder notes become darker with high opacity and softer notes thinner with low opacity. Composition Contemporary music compositions can rely directly on the distinct features of digital score technology. An example is the Chance Of Weather composition by Joseph Arkfeld based on Emily Dickinson’s poetic fragments “Fortitude - flanked with Melody”. The idea behind this project is to apply in the composition process the paradigm of fragment and variation as found in critical editions. The composition is made up of a set of fragments inspired by the poem and the encoding of the score is itself based on markup traditionally used for critical editions. Ultimately, the choice of the fragments for a particular instance of the composition is determined by an external data source, namely weather conditions (wind, cloud cover, temperature, etc.) at a geographical place to be chosen by the user. The weather conditions are transformed into a query that selects the corresponding fragments. Performance Interaction with music notation is quite common in the domain of performance. However, a significant breakthrough came on stage with the Music Encoding and Linked Data (MELD) framework and Climb!, a music composition that mixes the idea of classical virtuoso piece and computer game. The major innovation of the project is that the dataset is stored as Linked Data using MELD. Climb! is a non-linear composition also made from a set of fragments moving from the bottom to the top of a graph representing a mountain. The path of a performance is not pre-determined and changes at each performance. At some stages, the performer has to play some excerpts, whose accuracy is dynamically verified in order to decide if the performer can proceed to the next stage. Feedback to the performer can be provided by the highlighting of score fragments. Education In the field of music education, interactive applications are more and more common and increasingly sophisticated. They typically link music notation with recordings, but also with user feedback (measure tempo, tuning, etc.). They are often built as mobile device applications, such as the NomadPlay application. NomadPlay features a catalogue of recordings of a wide range of pieces from which the user can select his instrument. He can then rehearse the piece with the score of his instrument being displayed and synchronized with the recording but with the sound of his instrument removed. It is also possible to loop a difficult passage, or to change the tempo of the recording interactively."},{"id":3,"title":"Verovio licensing","url":"/introduction/licensing.html","body":"Verovio is licensed under the OSI-approved GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3). This means that Verovio can be used in any contexts that are compliant with the requirements of that license. In this section, we explain more concretely what you can do with it in your project, but also what is required or not allowed for you to do, and what we additionally recommend. What is allowed The LGPLv3 license allows you to use the Verovio library as-is in open-source projects that are compliant with this license. It can also be used in commercial products that are open-source or not. It can be a web application, a desktop application or a mobile one. The Verovio library can be embedded in the product and shipped with it without having your product itself to be open-source as long as the Verovio library is not modified and is dynamically linked to your product. What is required Whichever use you make of the library, you have to give visible credit to the Verovio library. For a web application, it has to be through a prominent notice on your web-site. For a mobile application, it has to be given in the metadata of the application (e.g., iOS App Store or the Google Play store). Here are some minimal examples to follow: Enote in the App Store Trala in Google Play NomadPlay web application Using Verovio in a product without giving credit is a clear license violation. However, it is also important to understand that, by giving the appropriate credits, you are not only fulfilling the very basic and free-of-charge requirements of the license but also supporting the community by recognizing its work. This will help us make Verovio better and more sustainable and will be beneficial to all users - including you - in the long-run. What is not allowed You are not allowed to make any modifications to the Verovio library without making all of your changes publicly available and under the original LGPLv3 license. For example, if you improve the layout algorithm, or add support for additional music notation elements, these improvements must be made open-source under LGPLv3. Not doing it is also a license violation and is un-supportive of the community. What is recommended Providing credit if you use Verovio, and making the source code of your modifications to the Verovio library available to the community, are the only minimal legal requirements. However, we strongly encourage you to go one step further and to ask for your changes to be integrated into the original code-base of Verovio with a pull-request to the rism-digital/verovio repository. Before your changes can be integrated into the repository, we will need you to accept the Verovio Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This is a standard procedure for open-source projects and will allow for the community to benefit directly from your work. We would also be happy to hear about your use of Verovio in your applications. Please get in touch if you are using Verovio, and let us know where we can learn more about your project!"},{"id":4,"title":"Introduction","url":"/first-steps/","body":"The first tutorial will look at how you can use Verovio to render music notation on a web page, using the pre-built JavaScript library. In this tutorial you will be building a small HTML page, with a minimal amount of JavaScript, to create an SVG rendering of an MEI file. In-depth technical expertise is not necessary, but you should be familiar with the basic principles of HTML to get the most out of this tutorial, and have access to a plain-text editor, preferably with facilities for automatically highlighting HTML and JavaScript code. (The Atom editor is a good choice if you need a recommendation.) By the end of this tutorial, you should understand the following: How to load the Verovio JavaScript library using the &lt;script&gt; tag; How to initialize Verovio, and how to set some basic rendering options; How to load an MEI file from a URL and pass it to Verovio to render; How to navigate between pages a multi-page score. Later tutorials will cover more in-depth topics, such as how to have more control over rendering options, how to interact with the rendered notation, and how to play the notation back using MIDI. Basic browser skills A good skill to have in working through these tutorials is how to access and use the JavaScript error console in your browser. Every modern browser comes with this facility. This feature is useful to see what might be causing problems since these problems may not be otherwise noticeable; your page just may not work, or it may not do what you expect. Accessing the JavaScript console is slightly different in each browser.

If you were building your own website, you may choose to host this on your own servers, but in this tutorial we will use a version that is hosted on the Verovio website. You can start with the following HTML page: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"http://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Save this in a plain text file somewhere on your hard-drive, and then open it with your browser. (The name does not matter, but it should end in .html; verovio.html is a good choice.) You should text in a large font that says “Hello Verovio!” but not much else. If you have your browser console open (discussed in the introduction), you should see no errors. To start Verovio, you should add the following to your page in the head, after the &lt;script&gt; tag that loads the Verovio toolkit: &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { Module.onRuntimeInitialized = async _ =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); } }); &lt;/script&gt; (If you are unsure, scroll to the bottom of this page; the full example is given below.) When you refresh your page, you should still see nothing, and there should be no errors in the browser console. To help you understand what this is doing, let’s start from the inside out. The line tk = new verovio.toolkit(); creates a new instance of the Verovio toolkit. This is what we will eventually use to render the notation. However, we first need to wait until the Verovio library is fully downloaded and ready to use by your browser. The Module.onRuntimeInitialized line, and the document.addEventListener lines do just that – they tell your browser to wait until other things have happened before trying to work with Verovio. This is a good, safe way to ensure all the requirements are met before we try to start working with Verovio. Logging to the Console While you are developing, it can be useful to write little notes to yourself to let you know what types of data you have, or to see what is happening at any given point in your code. As you proceed to more advanced uses you may wish to explore the browser’s built-in debugger, but until then a quick and easy way to do this is to use your browser’s error console. In your page, just after the line where you instantiate a new Verovio toolkit, insert the following: console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); When you refresh your page, you can see this note to yourself appear in the browser console. If no other errors appear, this gives you a critical pieces of information: Your browser has reached that point in execution, which means it has successfully loaded and initialized Verovio. If you do not see this, go back through the examples to see where you may have gone wrong. If you still cannot find this, you can find the full example for this stage of the tutorial below. You may notice that Verovio prints some warnings to your browser console. We can ignore these options for this tutorial, but if you are working with your own encoded scores and see these warnings it may help you track down problems or unexpected behaviours when rendering your scores. End of Section 1 At the end of this first section you should have a working web page, with a message printed to your browser console, and no other errors showing up. In the next section we will look at how to load and render some basic music notation in this page. Full example &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"http://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { Module.onRuntimeInitialized = async _ =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;"},{"id":6,"title":"Basic rendering","url":"/first-steps/basic-rendering.html","body":"At the end of part 1, we finished with a page that was successfully loading the Verovio library, but with nothing to display. In this part of the tutorial We will write some JavaScript that will fetch an MEI file from a URL, and then pass that MEI file to Verovio. This will turn the MEI file into an Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file that we can then embed in our page. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an image format that can be directly embedded into web pages. Vector graphics can be made larger or smaller with no pixellation, unlike other image formats you may be familiar with such as JPEG or PNG. Fetching MEI with JavaScript The first step is to fetch an MEI file from a URL. To do this, you can write the following in your HTML file, immediately after the console.log statement: fetch(\"https://www.verovio.org/examples/downloads/Schubert_Lindenbaum.mei\") .then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ) .then( (meiXML) =&gt; { let svg = tk.renderData(meiXML, {}); document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = svg; }); To break this down a bit, we start with a fetch statement with a URL; this tells your browser to try and load the file available at this address from a remote server. If it’s successful, then it should extract the XML data from the server: then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ). Finally, we take this MEI response and pass it off to our Verovio instance. Remember that we ‘started’ Verovio by creating a new Toolkit and assigning it to the variable tk? Well, now we are using this toolkit to render the MEI file. The result, as you might guess by the variable name (let svg = ...), will be some SVG. Once we have this SVG, we look through the page for HTML element with the id of “notation”. You should see a &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; line already in your HTML file. We set the content of this element (the innerHTML) to the SVG output of Verovio. If you refresh your HTML page now, you should see a rendered version of a Schubert lied, “Der Lindenbaum”. Congratulations! If you do not see this, go back and double-check that you do not have any errors in your browser console. End of Section 2 At the end of this section, you should have a page with some rendered music notation on it. It’s probably a bit too big, though, to read comfortably on your screen. You may also be wondering how Verovio handles larger scores, with lots of pages. We will answer these two questions in the next sections by looking at how we can control the layout options, and how we can use JavaScript to navigate the score dynamically. Full example &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=\"http://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit-wasm.js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script&gt; document.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", (event) =&gt; { Module.onRuntimeInitialized = async _ =&gt; { let tk = new verovio.toolkit(); console.log(\"Verovio has loaded!\"); fetch(\"https://www.verovio.org/examples/downloads/Schubert_Lindenbaum.mei\") .then( (response) =&gt; response.text() ) .then( (meiXML) =&gt; { let svg = tk.renderData(meiXML, {}); document.getElementById(\"notation\").innerHTML = svg; }); } }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello Verovio!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;div id=\"notation\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;"},{"id":7,"title":"Layout options","url":"/first-steps/layout-options.html","body":"Now that we have successfully rendered an MEI file to a web page, we can start to explore how to customize the SVG output. There are many possible options, most of which you will never need. To start, we will first try and reduce the size of the image output, to demonstrate how we can scale the music notation to fit the screen. Passing options to Verovio Passing options to Verovio is as easy as creating a set of key and value pairs, and using the setOptions method on the toolkit. To scale the output we will use the scale option. Add the following to your page, after we have instantiated the toolkit but before we render the data: tk.setOptions({ scale: 30 }); When you refresh your page, you should see your score scaled to 30% of its original size. Try experimenting with other values to see their effects! (Hint: you can use sizes above 100%.) Defaults All of the options have default values. You can use the getOptions method to view the list of all the options and their default values. We will use the browser console to explore these defaults. Add the following line: console.log(\"Verovio options:\", tk.getOptions()); When you refresh your page and open your browser’s console you should see the text “Verovio options:” followed by a small disclosure triangle. Clicking this triangle will produce a long list of options that you can pass to setOptions. Let’s try a few more. Change the page orientation You may have noticed that, by default, Verovio renders the score in “portrait” orientation; that is, the width of the score is shorter than the length. To change this, we can use the landscape and adjustPageWidth options: tk.setOptions({ scale: 30, landscape: true, adjustPageWidth: true }); When you refresh the page you should notice that your SVG has changed orientation! But wait… the score is now cut off! Where did the rest of it go? It turns out that Verovio has the ability to split scores into “pages” automatically. When it calculates the notation cannot fit on the current page, Verovio will automatically push it to the next page. Adjusting the different options will have an effect on this calculation, so it is worth looking through the options that we printed out, and trying some on your own. You may wish to change the pageWidth option, for example, to a bigger or smaller value and see what the result is. End of Section 3 In this section we have explored Verovio’s default options, and looked at how to adjust them to change the rendering output. In the next section we will look at how we can adjust these options dynamically, using on-screen controls to provide a user interface for building interactive music notation displays.

Its main goal is to develop a library with an internal structure identical to MEI as far as possible. For practical reasons, however, the Verovio library uses a page-based customization of MEI internally. Since the modifications introduced by the customization are very limited, the Verovio library can also be used to render un-customized MEI files. With the page-based customization, the content of the music is encoded in &lt;page&gt; elements that are themselves contained in a &lt;pages&gt; element within &lt;mdiv&gt;. A &lt;page&gt; element contains &lt;system&gt; elements. From there, the encoding is identical to standard MEI. That is, a &lt;system&gt; element will contain &lt;measure&gt; elements or &lt;staff&gt; elements that are both un-customized, depending on whether the music is measured or un-measured. Layout and positioning The idea of a page-based customization is also to make it possible to encode the positioning of elements directly in the content tree. This can be useful where the encoding represents one single source with one image per page. This is typically the case with optical music recognition applications. Verovio supports both positioned elements and automatic layout, which is the default when un-customized MEI files are rendered. The page-based organization is modeled by a MEI customization that defines the structure described above. The ODD file of the customization and the corresponding RNG schema are available from the MEI Incubator. This is still work-in-progress. SVG structure One advantage of SVG rendering over other formats (e.g., images or PDF) is that SVG is rendered natively in all modern web-browsers. Because it is in XML, it also has the advantage that it is well suited to interaction in the browser, since every graphic is an XML element that is easy addressable in the DOM. With Verovio, we also have the advantage that the SVG is organized in such a way that the MEI structure is preserved as much as possible. To give an example, a &lt;note&gt; element with an xml:id attribute in the MEI file will have a corresponding &lt;g&gt; element in the SVG with and class attribute with a value of \"note\" and an id attribute corresponding to the xml:id. This makes interaction with the SVG using JavaScript very easy. The hierarchy of the element is also preserved as shown below. &lt;tuplet xml:id=\"t1\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"&gt; &lt;beam xml:id=\"b1\"&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n1\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\" /&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n2\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"16\" dots=\"1\"/&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n3\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"32\" /&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n4\" pname=\"c\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\" accid=\"s\"/&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;beam xml:id=\"b2\"&gt; &lt;tuplet xml:id=\"t2\" num=\"3\" numbase=\"2\"&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n5\" pname=\"d\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\" /&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n6\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"16\" dots=\"1\"/&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n7\" pname=\"f\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"32\" accid=\"s\"/&gt; &lt;note xml:id=\"n8\" pname=\"e\" oct=\"5\" dur=\"8\"/&gt; &lt;/tuplet&gt; &lt;/beam&gt; &lt;g class=\"tuplet\" id=\"t1\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"beam\" id=\"b1\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n1\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n2\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n3\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n4\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"beam\" id=\"b2\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"tuplet\" id=\"t2\"&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n5\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n6\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n7\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;g class=\"note\" id=\"n8\"&gt;&lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt; &lt;/g&gt;"},{"id":15,"title":"Transposition","url":"/advanced-topics/transposition.html","body":"Transposition in Verovio uses the base-40 system that allows for an arbitrary maximum sharp/flat count (where base-40 can handle up to double sharps/flats). The option --transpose can be given two types of data: (1) a chromatic interval, or (2) a tonic pitch in the new key with optional direction and octave of transposition added. Transposition by chromatic interval For transposition by chromatic intervals, the format is an optional sign, followed by a chromatic quality followed by a diatonic number of steps. Examples: +M2 = up major second, -d5 = down diminished fifth The direction of the interval, with - indicating down and no sign or a + means up. A special cases is P1 which is a perfect unison, so +P1 and -P1 are equivalent since there is no movement up or down. For the chromatic quality of the interval, P means perfect, M means major, m means minor, d means diminished, A means augmented, dd means doubly diminished (and so on), AA means doubly augmented (and so on). For [PdA] the case of the letter does not matter so [pDa] should be interpreted as equivalent. M and m are case-sensitive (major and minor). The diatonic interval is any (reasonable) positive integer. A unison is 1, a second is 2, and so on. Compound intervals an octave and above can also be represented, such as 8 for an octave, a 9 for a ninth (octave plus a second), 10 for a tenth (octave plus a third), 15 is two octaves, and 16 is two octaves plus a second. Verovio will print an error message if the string option is not formatted correctly, and it will return an error interval which is a very large interval going down. Example interval names: name meaning P1 perfect unison M2 major second up +M2 major second up -M2 major second down m2 minor second up d2 diminished second up dd2 doubly diminished second up A2 augmented second up AA2 doubly augmented second up M3 major third up P4 perfect fourth up d4 diminished fourth up A4 augmented fourth up P8 perfect octave up P15 two perfect octaves up m10 perfect octave plus minor third up Transposition by tonic pitch For transposition by tonic pitch names, the format is made up of an optional direction, a pname and an accid. If no direction is given, then the smallest interval will be chosen. For example if starting from C major and transposing to G major, the calculated interval will be down a perfect fourth, since the G below C is closer than the G above C. When the direction is +, the next higher pitch that matches the new tonic will define the interval. For C major to G major, this is a perfect fifth up. When the direction is -, the next lowest pitch that matches the new tonic will define the interval. For C major to G major, this is a perfect fourth down. The + or - direction can be doubled/tripled/etc. to indicate additional octave transpositions. For example --g from C major means to transpose down an octave and a fourth: The fourth to the G below, and then the octave to the next lower G. Likewise, +++g from C major means to transpose up two octaves and a fifth: A fifth to the G above, then ++ means two octaves above that G. When using a case-insensitive @pname for the tonic of the new key, use ([A-Ga-g]) followed by an optional accid for the new key tonic. This is also case-insensitive: ([Ss]*|[Ff]*). Examples: tonic parameter meaning g transpose current tonic to closest G tonic note (up or down a fourth from current tonic) +g transpose to the next higher G tonic -g transpose down to next lower G tonic ++g transpose to second next higher G tonic --g transpose to second next lower G tonic ff transpose to nearest F-flat -cs transpose to next lower C-sharp ++BF transpose up to second next higher B-flat Illustrated examples Here is a test example music to transpose - note the @key.sig is expected for transposition to work properly: Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} &lt;score&gt; &lt;scoreDef&gt; &lt;staffGrp&gt; &lt;staffDef n=\"1\" lines=\"5\" clef.shape=\"G\" clef.line=\"2\" meter.sym=\"common\" key.sig=\"0\"/&gt; &lt;/staffGrp&gt; &lt;/scoreDef&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;measure right=\"end\" n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;staff n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;layer n=\"1\"&gt; &lt;chord dur=\"1\"&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"c\"/&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"e\"/&gt; &lt;note oct=\"4\" pname=\"g\"/&gt; &lt;/chord&gt; &lt;/layer&gt; &lt;/staff&gt; &lt;/measure&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/score&gt; Setting transpose: \"M2\" will transpose the music up a major second from C to D: Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Setting transpose: \"-m2\" To go down a minor second from C to B: Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Common intervals: m3 = minor third, M3 = major 3rd, P4 = perfect fourth, P5 = perfect fifth, d5 = diminished fifth, A4 = augmented fourth. It is also possible to give semitone steps, with 1 being one semitone, 2 being two semitones, etc. This method is less precise, and the computer will make an automatic calculating to minimize the number of accidentals in the target key signature. For example transpose: \"1\" will display in D-flat major: Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} This is equivalent to going up a minor second with transpose: \"-m2\": Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} If you need to transpose to C-sharp major, then you cannot use integers, but must use the full musical interval, which in this case is transpose: \"A1\" for an augmented unison: Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} (a1 and A1 are the same, but m2 and M2 are not equivalent). It is also possible to give the tonic note of the new key. For example transpose: \"E\" means to transpose to E major (or minor, since the mode will not be changed). This feature requires that the music contain key information which is not always present in MusicXML data. It can also be incorrect, which may cause problems, so use this option with care in an automatic situation.

If all parts have the same transposition (or no parts have transposition), then use the @pname and @accid as the reference pitch for which an interval will be calculated for the input transposition target tonic. If all parts do not have the same transposition, then choose a part that does not have a transposition from which to extract the key information. If all parts have transpositions, but the transpositions are different, then apply transposition to the key information to get it to sounding pitch for one of those instruments and use this transposed pitch as the basis for the key transposition. The key information may be stored in one of two main locations: staffDef@key.pname/staffDef@key.accid (the most common currently) or keySig@pname/keySig@accid. The staffDef@key.mode/keySig@mode is not needed. This key information must come before the first notes on the staff. keySig may be found as a child of staffDef, or may be found outside of the staffDef (at the start layer) or in scoreDef if it applies to all staves in the score (or the majority of staves in the score?). If there is no key information found before the first notes of the music, print an error warning and do not transpose. Once the original key is known, then the interval necessary for transposition can be calculated. The next step is to identify the closest new tonic’s octave. For extra + or - in the tonic string, add an octave to the interval to calculate the final interval for transposition. At this point the key transposition process becomes equivalent to the interval transposition process."},{"id":16,"title":"SMuFL fonts","url":"/advanced-topics/smufl.html","body":"Most music notation software applications use music fonts for rendering music symbols or parts of music symbols. These may include clefs, note heads, time signatures or articulation signs. However, these fonts often have incompatible code points – the internal location within the font that points to a symbol. They are most of the time developed with no common agreement on which code point represents which character. The code point for the G clef symbol in one font may be the code point used for a quarter rest in another, or may be simply undefined. Furthermore, they usually have their own metric and positioning system for specifying what the size of the glyph is and where its baseline is. Because of this, music fonts are difficult to use interchangeably. To address this, the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL) specification has been developed to attempt to harmonize code points across music fonts by specifying code points and symbol sizes for music fonts. SMuFL gives users the ability to reference specific Unicode code points with the understanding that it would represent the same, or similar, symbol across fonts. This presents new opportunities for exploring visual representations of music within a music encoding system without necessarily tying them to a particular font. While previous music encoding systems could not reference font code points without becoming tied to that font for representation, the introduction of SMuFL to music encoding can provide a reference to a particular graphical symbol that should be used to render a given encoding. Verovio follows the SMuFL specification. It means that it is possible to easily change the music font used in Verovio for personalised output. Verovio includes the Leipzig font, its own SMuFL-compliant music font. Leipzig was initially developed by Etienne Darbellay and Jean-François Marti as part of the Wolfgang music notation software. It is SMuFL compliant since version 5.0 and distributed under the SIL Open Font License. Verovio also supports and includes the Bravura font designed by Daniel Spreadbury, and the Gootville and Leland fonts designed by the MuseScore community. Fonts included can be selected by setting the --font option. For example, the Bravura font can be selected with the --font Bravura option on the command-line tool or by adding { font: \"Bravura\" } in the JavaScript toolkit options.

MEI is assume to be the default format if auto detection fails. In such cases, the format can be given explicitly with the option --input-from (or -f). MEI The native input format for Verovio is MEI. Verovio supports MEI as input format from MEI 2013 onwards. From Verovio 2.x.x, the plan is to have even version numbers for Verovio releases using a stable version of MEI, and odd version numbers for releases using a development version of MEI. It means that once MEI 5.0 will be released, Verovio will move to version 4.x.x. Older versions of MEI are still supported by newer versions of Verovio. When loading MEI data into Verovio and outputting MEI, elements that are not supported by Verovio will be ignored. This means that they are not loaded into memory and will not be preserved in the MEI output. This includes the element themselves, but also any descendant they might have. A warning will be given in the console. For example: [Warning] Unsupported '&lt;ossia&gt;' within &lt;measure&gt; Support for previous version of MEI When an MEI file in loaded into Verovio and is not of the latest version for that version of Verovio, it performs upgrade steps for the features that were supported by Verovio for that older version of MEI. MEI 2013 files Various attributes in &lt;page&gt; and &lt;measure&gt; for the page-based version of MEI are upgraded (experimental work). MEI 3.0 files The following elements / attributes are upgraded: beatRpt fTrem@slash instrDef@midi.volume mordent@form turn@form staffDef@barthru staffDef@label staffDef@label.abbr staffGrp@label staffGrp@label.abbr @dur.ges Original data &lt;beatRpt rend=\"4\"/&gt; &lt;beatRpt rend=\"8\"/&gt; &lt;beatRpt rend=\"16\"/&gt; &lt;beatRpt form=\"4\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;beatRpt slash=\"1\"/&gt; &lt;beatRpt slash=\"1\"/&gt; &lt;beatRpt slash=\"2\"/&gt; &lt;beatRpt slash=\"1\"/&gt; Original data &lt;fTrem slash=\"2\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;fTrem beams=\"2\"/&gt; Original data &lt;instrDef midi.volume=\"111\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;instrDef midi.volume=\"87.40%\"/&gt; Original data &lt;mordent form=\"inv\"/&gt; &lt;mordent form=\"norm\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;mordent form=\"upper\"/&gt; &lt;mordent form=\"lower\"/&gt; Original data &lt;turn form=\"inv\"/&gt; &lt;turn form=\"norm\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;turn form=\"lower\"/&gt; &lt;turn form=\"upper\"/&gt; Original data &lt;staff barthru=\"true\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;staff bar.thru=\"true\"/&gt; Original data &lt;staffDef label=\"violin I\" label.abbr=\"vl I\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;staffDef&gt; &lt;label&gt;Violin I&lt;label&gt; &lt;labelAbbr&gt;Vl I&lt;labelAbbr&gt; &lt;/staffDef&gt; Original data &lt;note dur.ges=\"8p\"/&gt; &lt;note dur.ges=\"32r\"/&gt; &lt;note dur.ges=\"32s\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;note dur.ppq=\"8\"/&gt; &lt;note dur.recip=\"32\"/&gt; &lt;note dur.real=\"32\"/&gt; MEI 4.0 files The following elements / attributes are upgraded: mensur@tempus mensur@prolatio Original data &lt;mensur tempus=\"3\"/&gt; &lt;mensur tempus=\"2\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;mensur tempus=\"3\" sign=\"0\"/&gt; &lt;mensur tempus=\"2\" sign=\"C\"/&gt; Original data &lt;mensur prolatio=\"3\"/&gt; &lt;mensur prolatio=\"2\"/&gt; Upgraded data &lt;mensur prolatio=\"3\" dot=\"true\"/&gt; &lt;mensur prolatio=\"2\" dot=\"false\"/&gt; Page-based MEI The MEI page-based model is not part of MEI. It was put in place for the development of Verovio and can still change in the future. It will be documented as input format once it is stabilized. Humdrum Humdrum data is an analytic music code for transcribing fully polyphonic textures. Humdrum syntax presents notes of the score in strict time sequence. Each data row represents all notes sounding or events occurring at the same time, and each column traces the melodic line of the individual parts. More information about the syntax is available on the Humdrum website. Examples The following example from Mozart’s piano sonata in F major, K1 280 (K6 189e), mvmt. 1, is generated dynamically within this page using the JavaScript form of Verovio, inputting the Humdrum data that follows.

The first column represents music on the bottom staff, the second column represents the top staff, and the third column contains the dynamics, which in this case apply to both staves. !!!COM: Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus !!!OTL: Piano Sonata No. 2 in F major !!!OMV: 1 !!!SCT1: K1 280 !!!SCT2: K6 189e !!!OMD: Allegro assai **kern **kern **dynam *staff2 *staff1 *staff1/2 *clefF4 *clefG2 * *k[b-] *k[b-] * *F: *F: * *M3/4 *M3/4 * *MM152 *MM152 * =1- =1- =1- 4FF 4F 4c: 4f: 4a: 4cc: f 4C 4a/ 4cc/ . 4AA 4a/ 4cc/ . =2 =2 =2 4FF 4.a/ 4.cc/ . 4FFF . . .

When on a VHV notation page, try pressing the key “p” to view the scan of the original print from which the musical data was encoded. Also try pressing “m” to view the internal conversion to MEI data. Vi users can try pressing “v” to toggle between the basic and vim modes for the text editor. Use the left/right arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown to navigate to different pages. Press shift-left/right arrows to go to the next/previous work/movement in the repertory. Sample repertories of Humdrum data displayed in the Verovio Humdrum Viewer: J.S. Bach chorales (When viewing a chorale, type the “o” letter key to toggle view of the original historic clefs.)

Command-line interface usage To typeset music in the Humdrum format on the command-line: $ verovio -f humdrum input.krn -o output.svg You can usually use the auto-detection feature of verovio by omitting the option. $ verovio input.krn -o output.svg The output filename will have the same basename as the input if the option is not given, so in this case the output will be called . $ verovio file.krn Standard input/output can be used with the verovio command by giving a dash for standard input and to send the output to standard output. $ cat input.krn | verovio - -o - &gt; output.svg To convert to MEI data: $ verovio file.krn --no-layout --all-pages -t mei A more complicated example Below is a song for voice and piano accompaniment. Each verse is listed in a separate spine of **text in addition to the three staves of music in **kern spines and one dynamics (**dynam) spine.

MusicXML Verovio has two converters for importing MusicXML data. The first one directly converts MusicXML into MEI. The second one first converts to Humdrum and then converts the Humdrum to MEI. By default, the first importer is used. It is also the one triggered when the value xml is passed to the --input-from option. Compressed MusicXML files Verovio supports MusicXML compressed (MXL) files. It only loads basic single-file MusicXML MXL files containing the index file (META-INF/container.xml) and the MusicXML file, with the extension .xml. The input process searches for the META-INF/container.xml file from which the filename of the MusicXML file is extracted. The filename extracted is the first ./rootfile@full-path listed in /container/rootfiles. Input of MXL files is auto detected and the xml value does not have to be passed to --input-format. However, when using the JavaScript toolkit, you need to make sure your data is an ArrayBuffer or a base64 string, and use loadZipDataBuffer() or loadZipDataBase64() respectively to load it instead loadData(). Here is an example using the JavaScript Fetch API, loading the file as an ArrayBuffer: fetch( mxlUrl ) .then( response =&gt; response.arrayBuffer() ) .then( data =&gt; { vrvToolkit.loadZipDataBuffer( data ) // Do anything else you want with the file here } ).catch( e =&gt; { console.log( e ); } ); Importing MusicXML via Humdrum The MusicXML import via Humdrum is available only for Verovio builds where Humdrum support has been enabled specifically at build time. For the JavaScript toolkit, this is not the default and it is important to make sure that the appropriate build is being used. See the related section for more information about this. With the command-line tool and the Python toolkit, Humdrum support is enabled by default. With Verovio builds that support Humdrum, the MusicXML import via Humdrum can be triggered by setting the --input-from option to musicxml-hum. For example: verovio -f musicxml-hum -t hum file.xml The MusicXML import via Humdrum can itself be made the default MusicXML importer with the build option MUSICXML_DEFAULT_HUMDRUM. See the command-line section for more information on how to change build options. With this, MusicXML files will be loaded via the Humdrum importer without having to specify musicxml-hum for the option --input-from. The direct importer can still be used by passing the value xml to --input-from. Plaine and Easie The Plaine &amp; Easie Code is a library standard that enables entering music incipits in modern or mensural notation. It is mostly used by the Répertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM) for inventorying the music incipits of the manuscripts. More information about the syntax is available on the IAML website. Plaine and Easie input in Verovio is a text file (or string) with a list of the following @key:value lines: @clef – the initial clef @keysig – the initial key signature @timesig – the initial time signature @data – the incipit content From version 3.7, the content can be structured as a JSON object with a clef, keysig, timesig and data key. Verovio will auto detect both as Plaine &amp; Easie format. Internaly, text files with @key:value lines are converted into a JSON object. The structure of this input format is not part of the PAE specification but only a convention put in place for Verovio Examples Beams and tuplets Text file input @clef:G-2 @keysig:xFCGD @timesig:3/8 @data:'6B/{8B+(6B''E'B})({AFD})/{6.E3G},8B-/({6'EGF})({FAG})({GEB})/4F6- JSON input { \"clef\": \"G-2\", \"keysig\": \"xFCGD\", \"timesig\": \"3/8\", \"data\": \"'6B/{8B+(6B''E'B})({AFD})/{6.E3G},8B-/({6'EGF})({FAG})({GEB})/4F6-\" } Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Measure rests and key and time signature changes @clef:G-2 @keysig:xF @timesig:3/8 @data:=25//=5//$xFCG @c 2-4.-'8E/{6AGFE}{8A''C}'B''4D{6C'B}/{''DC'BA}{''8EA} Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Clef changes @clef:F-4 @keysig:bB @timesig:c @data:,6{FA'CF} %G-2{''6CEA'''C} %F-4{,6FB'DF} %G-2{''6DFA'''D}/ Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Trills and fermata @clef:C-4 @keysig:xFC @timesig:c/ @data:,{8.A6A}/'4.Dt8D4.Ct8D/{8.E6C},8(A)'E4DtE/{8.Ft3GE}8(D)-2-/ Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Ties @clef:G-2 @keysig:xFCG @timesig:3/8 @data:''8-{CD}+/{DC'B}/{xAB''F+}/{FED}/{CGB+}/{BAG+}/{GFE}/ Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Grace notes (acciaccaturas) @clef:G-2 @keysig:bBE @timesig:2/4 @data:''{8.F6D'8B}6-''F/{8.F6E8C}6-E/{8DC}{'8B''gCg'BgAgB''6FE}/2D Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Grace notes (appoggiaturas) @clef:F-4 @keysig:xF @timesig:c @data:qq,3{DnF'D}r/2Fqq,3{DnF'D}r2Aqq3,{DF'D}r/b1B,qq3{EG'C}r/1A// Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Rhythmic patterns @clef:C-1 @keysig:xFCGD @timesig:c @data:'2-4.-8D/{EG}6.3{BA}{GF}{ED}{EF}{GA}{GF}/4E Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Abbreviated writing @clef:G-2 @keysig: @timesig:3/4 @data:'6!{GGCC}!f{GCGC}/i/i/ Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} PAE Validation The toolkit can be used to validate Plaine &amp; Easie input data with the ValidatePAE or ValidatePAEFile methods. The methods load the PAE data passed as a string or from a file respectively. They both return a stringified JSON object with validation error or warning messages. The JSON object can contain one or more validation messages. When a global input error is encountered (e.g, data is missing in the input), a single object is returned. Otherwise, the object is structured with keys corresponding to the JSON input keys (clef, keysig, timesig and data). Each key can have one single validation message, except for data that contains an array of one or more messages. Only keys for which a validation message is given will exist in the validation object. In non-pendantic mode, syntax problems are marked as warning as long as parsing can continue. Each validation message is structured as follow: { \"column\": 0, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 1, \"text\": \"A description of the validation problem\", \"type\": \"error\" } Description of the values: The column indicates the position where the problem occurs in the input string. It is always 0 for clef, keysig and timesig. It can be -1 in data when no position can be indicated. The row is always 0. The type can be error or warning. The code corresponds to a numeric error code that can be used to map the errors into another system and (for example) to translate the messages. Whenever the error message contains a string interpolation %s, then the json message also contains a value key with the value to be used for the interpolation. Here is an example of invalid input data and the object returned by the validation call: { \"clef\": \"GG2\", \"keysig\": \"bB\", \"data\": \"=1/4-''DC'tB/''tCC\" } { \"clef\": { \"column\": 0, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 43, \"text\": \"Unexpected second character in clef sign\", \"type\": \"warning\" }, \"data\": [ { \"column\": 10, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 17, \"text\": \"Invalid t not after a note\", \"type\": \"warning\" }, { \"column\": 15, \"row\": 0, \"code\": 17, \"text\": \"Invalid t not after a note\", \"type\": \"warning\" } ] } ABC Abc is a text-based music notation system originally designed for use with folk and traditional tunes and used throughout the web.

Rettinghaus Verovio takes several information fields into account, e.g. the reference number X, the tune title T, the meter M, the unit note length L, the key K. As you can see, Verovio prints the header as expected by default. You may suppress this behaviour with the --header none option.

Font limitation Firefox on Linux (Ubuntu), uses “DejaVu Serif” as default font, which can cause some text layout problems when displaying the SVG files generated with Verovio. MEI With its MEI output, Verovio can serve as a converter to MEI. This can be useful for converting data from another input format supported by Verovio (e.g., MusicXML, ABC) to MEI. It can also be used to upgrade files encoded in an older version of MEI to the one supported by the version of Verovio that being used. Another typical use-case where outputting MEI from Verovio can be desirable is for transposing content. When converting other formats to MEI, it is important to keep in mind that the output produced by Verovio will only include the MEI features (elements and attributes) currently supported by the Verovio version being used. It is also important to remember that the MEI produced by Verovio is only one way to express things in MEI and that MEI will often offer other valid and recommendable ways to represent the same things. Choosing between them depends on the goal being pursued. It is possible that Verovio is the appropriate solution but not necessary. When converting from an older version of MEI, it is important to remember that Verovio will not perform any upgrade of the data encoded in the MEI header, with the exception of the MEI version. This means that using Verovio for upgrading MEI data is probably appropriate only for encodings that feature a very basic header and is not recommended with rich ones. It is recommended to check what has changed in MEI for the header between the versions. In any case, it is strongly recommended to check the header by validating the output files produced by Verovio. Regarding the content, Verovio will upgrade only the features that used to be supported in the previous version. See the section on MEI in the Input formats in the previous section for more detail about what is upgraded. Unsupported elements and attributes When loading MEI data into Verovio and outputting MEI, the following is to expect regarding MEI elements and attributes that are currently not supported by Verovio. Because elements that are not supported by Verovio are ignored and are not loaded into memory, they will not be preserved in the MEI output. This includes the element themselves, but also any descendant they might have. As described in the section about the Input formats, a warning will appear in the console about these. There is one exception with the &lt;annot&gt; elements for which all the content will be preserved, including MEI element descendants that are not supported elsewhere in Verovio. Regarding attributes, Verovio will preserve in the output all attributes, including the one that are not supported or that have not relevance for the rendering. Analytical markup When loading MEI data into Verovio, some analytical markup is converted into standard markup. The attributes that are converted are: @fermata @tie For example: Original data &lt;note t=\"i\" xml:id=\"n1\"/&gt; &lt;note t=\"t\" xml:id=\"n2\"/&gt; Output data &lt;tie startid=\"#n1\" endid=\"#n2\"/&gt; Original data &lt;mRest fermata=\"above\" xml:id=\"mr1\"/&gt; Output data &lt;fermata startid=\"#mr1\" place=\"above\"/&gt; By default, the analytical markup is not preserve in the MEI output. It can be with the option --preserve-analytical-markup. Articulations Articulations in MEI can be encoded with multiple values within a @artic attribute. Verovio implementation is based on single valued @artic attributes. When loading MEI data, multiple valued attributes are transformed into corresponding single valued ones by duplicating the &lt;artic&gt; element. This remain as such in the MEI output. For example: Original data &lt;artic artic=\"marc ten\" place=\"above\"/&gt; Output data &lt;artic artic=\"marc\" place=\"above\"/&gt; &lt;artic artic=\"ten\" place=\"above\"/&gt; Page-based MEI The MEI page-based model is not part of MEI. It was put in place for the development of Verovio and can still change in the future. It will be documented as input format once it is stabilized. MIDI Verovio provides a basic MIDI output feature that can be used from the command-line tool or from the JavaScript toolkit. The MIDI output can be written to a file for further processing or for building application with MIDI playback, including in online environments. However, since MIDI is not supported in web-browsers in a standard way, an additional player will be required in such cases. The MIDI output takes into account: Tempo indication (@midi.bpm) provided in the first scoreDef and in tempo elements. The sounding accidental values provided by @accid.ges on notes and accid. The sounding octave values provided by @oct.ges on note. Transposing instrument information provided by @trans.semi on staffDef. Tie elements referring to notes with @startid and @endid. Verovio uses the Midifile library for generating the MIDI output. Usage With the command-line tool, for generating a MIDI file with the default options, you need to do: verovio -t midi -o output.midi input-file.mei With the JavaScript toolkit, the MIDI output is available through the renderToMIDI() method. This returns a base64-coded MIDI file as string, which can be passed to a player or made available for download. Timemap The timemap is an array of JSON objects, with each entry having these keys: tstamp: this is the time in millisecond from the start of the music to the start of the current event (real time) qstamp: the time in quarter notes from the start of the music to the start of the current event entry (score time) tempo: when the tempo changes the new tempo will be given for the current event. Also the tempo changes are only allowed to occur at the starts of measures in the current code for creating MIDI files, and this is the same limitation for the timemap file. The tempo and qstamp values can be used to re-calculate a new set of tstamp values if the tempo changes. on: This is an array of note ids that start at the current event time. This list will not be given if there are no note ons at the current event. off: This is an array of note ids that end at the current event time. This list will not be given if there are no note offs at the current event.

See also there for the features supported. Note that: duration is given explicitly for every note no abbreviated writing is used in the Plaine and Easie output For example, let’s consider the following example passed as input to Verovio: @clef:G-2 @keysig: @timesig:3/4 @data:'6!{GGCC}!f{GCGC}/i/i/ Engraved by Verovio 3.4.1-8f65a58 g.page-margin{font-family:Times;} g.ending, g.reh, g.tempo{font-weight:bold;} g.dir, g.dynam, g.mNum{font-style:italic;} g.label{font-weight:normal;} Verovio will produce the following Plaine and Easie output: @keysig:b @timesig:3/4 @clef:G-2 @data:{6'G6G6C6C}{6G6G6C6C}{6G6C6G6C}/{6G6G6C6C}{6G6G6C6C}{6G6C6G6C}/{6G6G6C6C}{6G6G6C6C}{6G6C6G6C}/ Humdrum The Humdrum output format for Verovio is available only from MusicXML input and only if the Humdrum importer is used when loading the data into Verovio. See this section for more information about the MusicXML import via Humdrum. With this in hand, you can convert MusicXML to Humdrum from the command-line with: verovio -f musicxml-hum -t hum file.xml If the MusicXML importer via Humdrum is the default, you can simply do: verovio -t hum file.xml"},{"id":22,"title":"Toolkit methods","url":"/toolkit-reference/toolkit-methods.html","body":"ConvertHumdrumToHumdrum Filter Humdrum data.

It has be tested on several operating systems and architectures. This sections describes how to build the command-line version of the toolkit from the command-line or using some of the most popular IDEs. There are currently no pre-build binaries of the command-line toolkit available since building it is very straight-forward. MacOS or Linux To build the the command-line tool, you need CMake to be installed on your machine as well as a compiler supporting C++17. The commands to build are the following: cd tools cmake ../cmake make You can increase the building speed by using the -j option when running make that specifies the number of jobs to be run in parallel: make -j 8 The generates a verovio binary within ./tools. You can run Verovio from there or install it. Installing it means copying the executable and the resource files to directories which paths are globally accessible. You simply need to run: sudo make install If you do not install it and run it from ./tools or from another directory, you need to use the -r option to set the appropriate resource directory. The parameter of the -r option has to be a path to the ./data folder of the codebase. Keep in mind that if you have installed, you should not run another version without re-installing it or using the -r options because otherwise the resources installed can be invalid. A typical problem is missing font glyphs that a newer version needs but that are not in the older version of the resources. For seeing the command-line options, run: ./verovio --help (Until version 2.6.0, the cmake command was cmake . and not cmake ../cmake.) Basic usage For typesetting an MEI file with the default options, you need to do: verovio -o output.svg Hummel_Concerto_for_trumpet.mei If you use a version locally that is not installed, do not forget to add the -r parameter: ./verovio -r ../data -o output.svg Hummel_Concerto_for_trumpet.mei Additional building options By default the executable is not stripped. To strip it during the installation do sudo make install/strip For building it without Plain and Easy support, run: cmake ../cmake -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=ON To allow PAE support again, you must run the command cmake ../cmake -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=OFF since running cmake ../cmake will not clear the state of the define variable. The other building options are: NO_ABC_SUPPORT for the ABC importer to be turned on/off NO_MXL_SUPPORT for the compressed MusicXML importer to be turned on/off NO_HUMDRUM_SUPPORT for the Humdrum importer to be turned on/off MUSICXML_DEFAULT_HUMDRUM to use the MusicXML Humdrum importer by default instead of the direct MusicXML importer BUILD_AS_LIBRARY for Verovio to be built as dynamic shared library instead of a command-line executable Uninstall a previous version To uninstall a previously installed version of Verovio from the system, run: rm -f /usr/local/bin/verovio rm -rf /usr/local/share/verovio Occasionally there are problems with updates necessary to the Makefile when compiling a new version of Verovio with make. It may be necessary to clear out the automatically generated cmake files and regenerate them. To do that, run: rm -rf CMakeFiles CMakeCache.txt Makefile cmake_install.cmake Windows 10 To build Verovio on Windows 10 from the command-line, you will need to have Microsoft C++ Build Tools and make installed on your computer. Run the following commands from the x86 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS (with administrator privileges): cd &lt;sourceCode&gt;/tools cmake ../cmake -G \"NMake Makefiles\" nmake nmake install After the installation, add &lt;sourceCode&gt;/tools to the PATH of your system. When running the commands, the resource path should be provided explicitly with the following option: -r \"C:/Program Files (x86)/Verovio/share/verovio\" Xcode For MacOS users, there is also an Xcode project in the Verovio root directory. By default, humdrum support is turned off in Xcode. To turn in on, you need to use the Verovio-Humdrum building scheme. Visual Studio Install CMake Go into the tools folder of Verovio Execute cmake ../cmake -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=ON (add -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 for a x64 solution) Open the resulting Verovio.sln with Visual Studio and build it from there"},{"id":27,"title":"JavaScript and WebAssembly","url":"/installing-or-building-from-sources/javascript-and-webassembly.html","body":"Pre-build versions The verovio.org GitHub repository provides compiled versions of the JavaScript toolkit.

The latest release is always available from: https://www.verovio.org/javascript/latest/verovio-toolkit.js The latest development version is available from: https://www.verovio.org/javascript/develop/verovio-toolkit.js Previous releases are available from their corresponding directory, e.g.: https://www.verovio.org/javascript/2.7.1/verovio-toolkit.js NPM The latest stable version is available via NPM registry. The version distributed via NPM it the WebAssembly build. It can be installed with: npm install verovio The homepage of the Verovio package includes documentation on how to use it. The version with Humdrum support is also available via NPM registry since version 3.9.0. It is also in WebAssembly. It can be installed with: npm install verovio-humdrum Basic usage of the toolkit For instructions on a basic usage of the JavaScript version of the toolkit, see the Getting started section of the Tutorial 1: First steps chapter. Building the toolkit To build the JavaScript toolkit you need to have the Emscripten compiler installed on your machine. You also need CMake. You need to run: cd emscripten ./buildToolkit -H The toolkit will be written to: ./emscripten/build/verovio-toolkit.js Building without -H will include the Humdrum support, which increases the size of the toolkit by about one third. In that case, the output will be written to verovio-toolkit-hum.js.

The Python versions for which a pre-build is provided are 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9. The platforms supported are MacOS 10.9, Linux with manylinux for x86-64, Win-32 and Win-amd64. The latest release can be installed with: pip install verovio A previous version can be installed with: pip install verovio==3.2.0 For all platforms or architectures for which a pre-build version is not available in the PyPi repository, a source distribution is available. It can be installed with the same command as above. This will automatically trigger the compilation of the package. Basic usage of the toolkit Once installed, the Verovio tookit module can be imported with import verovio You can then create an instance of the toolkit and load data. For example: tk = verovio.toolkit() tk.loadFile(\"path-to-mei-file\") tk.getPageCount() Once loaded, the data can be rendered to a string: svg_string = tk.renderToSVG(1) It can also be rendered to a file: tk.renderToSVGFile( \"page.svg\", 1 ) Setting options The options are set on the toolkit instance. For example, the following code will change the dimensions of the page and redo the layout for the previously loaded data: tk.setOption( \"pageHeight\", \"2100\" ) tk.setOption( \"pageWidth\", \"2900\" ) tk.setScale(25) tk.redoLayout() tk.renderToSVGFile( \"page-scaled.svg\", 1 ) It is also possbile to collect options in a Python Dictionary and pass them as Json dump to the toolkit: import json options = { 'pageHeight': 1000, 'pageWidth': 1000 } tk.setOptions(json.dumps(options)) tk.redoLayout() tk.renderToSVGFile( \"page-square.svg\", 1 ) Building the toolkit To build the Python toolkit you need to have swig and swig-python installed on your machine (see SWIG) and the Python distutils package. Version 4.0 or newer of SWIG is recommended but older versions should work too. To install SWIG in MacOS using Homebrew, type the command brew install swig. The toolkit needs to be built from from the root directory of the repository content. To build it in-place, run: python setup.py build_ext --inplace If you want to install it, run: python setup.py build_ext sudo python setup.py install For building it with one or more specific options (e.g., without Plain and Easy support), run: python setup.py build_ext --inplace --define NO_PAE_SUPPORT Building a Python wheel locally You can build a Python wheel locally with: python setup.py bdist For a source distribution, do: python setup.py sdist In both cases, the wheel will be written to the ./dist directory. Building with CMake The Python toolkit can be built with CMake, which can be significantly faster because parallel processing can be used. This is also the approach to recommend when developing because it will not rebuild the entire codebase when a change it made to a file but only the files that actually need to rebuilt. For this approach to work you need at least version 3.13 of CMake because it uses the option -B introduced in that version of CMake. The steps are: cd bindings cmake ../cmake -B python -DBUILD_AS_PYTHON=ON cd python make -j8 If you want to enable or disable other specific options, you can do: cmake ../cmake -B python -DBUILD_AS_PYTHON=ON -DNO_PAE_SUPPORT=ON By default, Python 3 is used. If you want to use a specific version of Python, you can do: cmake ../cmake -B python -DBUILD_AS_PYTHON=ON -DPYTHON_VERSION=3.9 Installation with CMake has not be tested yet Resources for versions built locally When using a version built locally, you usually have to specify the path to the Verovio resources. To do so, you can do import verovio tk = verovio.toolkit(False) tk.setResourcePath(\"path-to-resource-dir\") Alternatively, you can set it before you create the instance of the toolkit import verovio verovio.setDefaultResourcePath(\"path-to-resource-dir\") tk = verovio.toolkit()"},{"id":29,"title":"Other bindings","url":"/installing-or-building-from-sources/other-bindings.html","body":"Java To build the Java toolkit you need to have swig and swig-java installed on your machine (see SWIG) as well as Maven. You need to run: cd bindings/java mvn package mvn package Note the mvn package command needs to be run twice. You can test it with the MEI and PAE examples. For example – replace X.X.X with the appropriate version number: cd example-mei javac -cp .:../target/VerovioToolkit-X.X.X.jar main.java java -cp .:../target/VerovioToolkit-X.X.X.jar main This should write an output.svg file in the current directory.

Formatting Verovio uses a ClangFormat (10.0) coding style based on the WebKit style, with a few minor modifications. The modifications include: AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: true AllowShortLoopsOnASingleLine: true ColumnLimit: 120 ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine: true PointerAlignment: Right The simplest way to fullfil the Verovio coding style is to use a clang-format tool and to apply the style defined in the .clang-format file available in the project root directory. How to install clang-format on macOS An easy way to install clang-format on macOS computers is to use Hombrew. Type this command in the terminal to install: brew install clang-format How to install clang-format on Ubuntu On Ubuntu clang-format is available in the universe repository. You can install it easily with the command: sudo apt install clang-format Running clang-format Please make sure you use at least version 10.0 To use clang-format to adjust a single file: clang-format -style=file -i some-directory/some-file.cpp The -style=file option instructs clang-format to search for the .clang-format configuration file (recursively in some parent directory). The -i option is used to alter the file “in-place”. If you don’t give the -i option, a fomatted copy of the file will be sent to standard output. Includes and forward declarations Includes in the header files must list first the system includes followed by the Verovio includes, if any, and then the includes for the libraries included in Verovio. All includes have to be ordered alphabetically: #include &lt;string&gt; #include &lt;utility&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include \"attclasses.h\" #include \"atttypes.h\" //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include \"pugixml.hpp\" #include \"utf8.h\" In the header files, always use forward declarations (and not includes) whenever possible. Forward declaration have to be ordered alphabetically: class DeviceContext; class Layer; class StaffAlignment; class Syl; class TimeSpanningInterface; In the implementation files, the first include in always the include of the corresponding header file, followed by the system includes and then the other Verovio includes with libraries at the end too, if any, also ordered alphabetically: #include \"att.h\" //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include &lt;sstream&gt; #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt; //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include \"object.h\" #include \"vrv.h\" //---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #include \"pugixml.hpp\" Null and boolean The null pointer value should be written as NULL. Boolean values should be written as true and false. Integer data types Integer numbers should be int, or char but only when this is clearly appropropriate. The use of short is to be avoided unless there are some particular reasons to use it. Variables and class members should not be unsigned numbers unless strictly necessary. Class, method and member names All class names must be in upper CamelCase. The internal capitalization follows the MEI one: class Measure; class ScoreDef; class StaffDef; All method names must also be in upper CamelCase: void Measure::AddStaff(Staff *staff) {} All member names must be in lower camelCase. Instance members must be prefixed with m_ and class (static) members with s_: class Glyph { public: /** An instance member */ int m_unitsPerEm; /** A static member */ static std::string s_systemPath; }; In the class declaration, the methods are declared first, and then the member variables. For both, the declaration order is public, protected, and private. Use of this The convention for the pointer this is to use it for method calls and not to use if for member access because these are prefixed with m_. As it stands, the codebase is not consistently following this convention Comments Comments for describing methods can be grouped using ///@{ and ///@} delimiters together with the @name indication: /** * @name Add children to an editorial element. */ ///@{ void AddFloatingElement(FloatingElement *child); void AddLayerElement(LayerElement *child); void AddTextElement(TextElement *child); ///@} LibMEI The code for the attribute classes of Verovio are generated from the MEI schema using a modified version of LibMEI available here. See the section Generate code with LibMEI for detailed information on how to modify and generate this code. The attribute classes generated from the MEI schema provide all the members for the element classes of Verovio. They are implemented via multiple inheritance in element classes. The element classes corresponding to the MEI elements are not generated by LibMEI but are implemented explicitly in Verovio. They all inherit from the Object class (of the vrv namespace) or from a Object child class. They can inherit from various interfaces used for the rendering. All the MEI member are defined through the inheritance of generated attribute classes, either grouped as interfaces or individually. For example, the MEI &lt;note&gt; is implemented as a Note class that inherit from Object through LayerElement. It also inherit from the StemmedDrawingInterface that holds data used for the rendering. Its MEI members are defined through the DurationInterface and PitchInterface that regroup common functionnalities for durational and pitched MEI elements respectively plus some additional individual attribute classes. The inheritance should always list Object (or the Object child class) first, followed by the rendering interfaces, followed by the attribute class interfaces, followed by the individual attribute classes, each of them ordered alphabetically: class Note : public LayerElement, public StemmedDrawingInterface, public DurationInterface, public PitchInterface, public AttColoration, public AttGraced, public AttStems, public AttTiepresent In the implementation, the same order must be followed, for the constructor calls and for the registration of the interfaces and individual attribute classes: Note::Note() : LayerElement(\"note-\") , StemmedDrawingInterface() , DurationInterface() , PitchInterface() , AttColoration() , AttGraced() , AttStems() , AttTiepresent() { RegisterInterface(DurationInterface::GetAttClasses(), DurationInterface::IsInterface()); RegisterInterface(PitchInterface::GetAttClasses(), PitchInterface::IsInterface()); RegisterAttClass(ATT_COLORATION); RegisterAttClass(ATT_GRACED); RegisterAttClass(ATT_STEMS); RegisterAttClass(ATT_TIEPRESENT); Reset(); } Resetting the attributes is required and follows the same order void Note::Reset() { LayerElement::Reset(); StemmedDrawingInterface::Reset(); DurationInterface::Reset(); PitchInterface::Reset(); ResetColoration(); ResetGraced(); ResetStems(); ResetTiepresent(); // ... }"},{"id":32,"title":"Contributing workflow","url":"/contributing/workflow.html","body":"When contributing to Verovio there are a few steps you can take to help make your contribution easy to understand and evaluate. Verovio uses the GitHub issue tracker and pull requests mechanism to organize these contributions. These steps are: Provide an short example MEI encoding that demonstrates a bug or a new feature that can be included in our test suite. You can use the Verovio Editor to create your example. This is described in more detail below. Open an issue describing the problem or the new feature, and attach your short example. This provides our developer community with an opportunity to provide feedback on the problem, and determine the appropriate course of action. If you can also provide the solution to the problem by modifying the Verovio source code, then that will speed up the process of getting your issue fixed! If you are a first-time contributor, then please make sure you have read the contributing guidelines. When you are ready, open a Pull Request, making sure to reference the open issue that it solves. Adding examples to the test-suite When adding examples to the test-suite, you should keep in mind the following points: The example should be as minimal as possible, ideally one or two measures and without un-related MEI / notation features The example has to be valid MEI (4.0 or 5.0-dev) The header should follow the test-suite style The XML should be indented with 3-spaces It is not mandatory to have an @xml:id on all MEI elements The file name should follow the test-suite style Example header Example MEI header for a test-suite example: &lt;meiHead&gt; &lt;fileDesc&gt; &lt;titleStmt&gt; &lt;title&gt;Slur position with cross-staff&lt;/title&gt; &lt;respStmt&gt; &lt;persName role=\"editor\"&gt;Laurent Pugin&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;persName role=\"encoder\"&gt;Craig Sapp&lt;/persName&gt; &lt;/respStmt&gt; &lt;/titleStmt&gt; &lt;pubStmt&gt; &lt;date isodate=\"2021-01-06\"&gt;2021-01-06&lt;/date&gt; &lt;pubPlace&gt; &lt;ref target=\"https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio/issues/1898\" /&gt; &lt;/pubPlace&gt; &lt;/pubStmt&gt; &lt;notesStmt&gt; &lt;annot&gt;Slurs with cross-staff should be place identically as in normal situations.&lt;/annot&gt; &lt;/notesStmt&gt; &lt;/fileDesc&gt; &lt;encodingDesc&gt; &lt;appInfo&gt; &lt;application version=\"3.1.0\" label=\"2\"&gt; &lt;name&gt;Verovio&lt;/name&gt; &lt;/application&gt; &lt;/appInfo&gt; &lt;/encodingDesc&gt; &lt;/meiHead&gt; File names The test suite examples are grouped by element name, with a very few exceptions. There is a corresponding folder name in the test suite folder. A test-suite example should be saved in the folder corresponding to the MEI element it targets. File names also use the element name and are numbered using the three digits (-001.mei) pattern. Additional options In some cases, a test suite example can require specific Verovio options to be set for it to make sense. For instance, it can require a specific layout or spacing parameter, or a specific font. The options can be set in the header of the MEI file as JSON object encoded as CDATA in the &lt;extMeta&gt; tag. For example, setting the Bravura font can be triggered by including the following tag in the header of the test suite example: &lt;extMeta&gt;&lt;![CDATA[{ \"font\": \"Bravura\" }]]&gt;&lt;/extMeta&gt; The additional options set in the MEI header are taken into account in both the test-suite page and the test-suite evaluation performed by the GitHub Actions. However, they currently remain ignored in the Verovio Editor. What to expect with an open issue When opening an issue, you should be prepared to help shepherd it through the process of getting fixed. If it is a problem with the software itself and you do not know how to fix it, you can still help with testing any potential fixes. You can also help by improving documentation about the new feature by contributing to the Verovio book, as appropriate. Please do not open an issue unless you are willing to help, in some way, solve it. If you open an issue and someone provides a fix that requires no further changes, please respond! A “thank-you” and a note to say that it fixed the problem is always appreciated. You can also close the issue so that we know it has been addressed. Sometimes an issue may be open for several years. These issues may be particularly complex, or may have been partially but not fully fixed. They usually have a discussion attached with sample encodings. Sometimes these issues have actually been fixed later, but as part of a separate issue. If you open an issue that happens to be fixed later, you can help us by leaving a note on your issue and closing it yourself. If you are a software developer and can provide a solution, you should mention this in your issue. For new contributors it is useful to open issues prior to opening pull requests. Sometimes a change cannot be accepted, so opening an issue first gives an opportunity for the more experienced members of the community to provide feedback before you invest a lot of time in it. The quickest and easiest way to get help is to reach out on the #verovio channel in the MEI Community’s Slack chat. If you are not already a member, you can join. Issues that have a code contribution attached, and which have active participation from the reporter, are typically addressed first and fixed sooner. This is largely due to the community-driven nature of the project, recognizing that the more experienced developers have their own set of priorities. If you can provide a fix, even if it is not 100% correct, then it is easier to review your contribution and provide feedback than it is for someone else to code something from the ground up. If Verovio is a critically important part of your project, and you need dedicated help to make changes and contributions, the Verovio project accepts some sponsorship arrangements.

It can be adapted to generate code in any language. For Verovio, it is used to generate C++ code. The code generated with LibMEI is included in the Verovio repository in the ./libmei directory and the LibMEI repository does not need to be cloned for building Verovio. Whenever the MEI schema is modified, this code needs to be re-generated in order to integrate these changes. However, since Verovio implements only a small subset of the MEI schema, this really needs to be done only for the changes in the schema that touch features supported by Verovio. This means that the code within the ./libmei directory should never be edited by hand because any change will be overwritten by the LibMEI output when the code generated from the schema needs to be updated and LibMEI is run again. Running LibMEI In order to update to code generated with LibMEI, you need to clone the forked version of LibMEI. LibMEI takes a compiled ODD as input. You need to run, from the LibMEI directory: python tools/parseschema2.py -l vrv -o /path/to/the/verovio/directory -i tools/includes/vrv mei/dev/mei-verovio_compiled.odd You need to set to option -o to point to the Verovio directory where the ./libmei files will be written. Customization Verovio currently uses an MEI customization that adds or modified a few elements. It is defined in the ./mei/dev/mei-verovio.xml file. If you want to makes changes to it, you can make them there. You will need to re-generate the ./mei/dev/mei-verovio_compiled.odd ODD file. This can be done using the Edirom MEI Garage. Alternatively, you can also use the MEI command-line script. To do so, you will need to a clone of the MEI repository, copy your customization file (e.g., mei-verovio.xml) into it and do: ant init ant -lib lib/saxon/saxon9he.jar -Dcustomization.path=mei-verovio.xml The ODD file will be written to ./dist/schemata/mei-verovio_compiled.odd, which you can use as new input file for LibMEI."},{"id":34,"title":"Adding SMuFL glyphs","url":"/contributing/adding-smufl-glyphs.html","body":"All SMuFL glyphs used by Verovio have to be available in the Leipzig font. For adding support for a new SMuFL glyph, the steps are: Add the glyph to the Leipzig font file Generate the Leipzig font as SVG font Add the glyph to the list of supported glyph in the XSL list Make sure you always add glyphs only in the develop-leipzig branch because conflict solving is problematic with the process of adding a glyph, in particular for the Leipzig font file. For this reason, make sure you always pull the latest version from the develop-leipzig branch before starting your work and do not wait too long before making a PR. If changes have been made in between, you will need to add your glyphs again. When making a PR, always add an image (e.g., screenshot of FontForge) showing the glyphs. Adding the glyph to the Leipzig font file The file is ./fonts/Leipzig-5.2.sfd and should be edited with FontForge. Very often it is possible to copy another existing glyph as basis for the new glyph. Leipzig is visually lighter and thinner than Bravura and new glyphs have to follow this design choice. Do not copy glyphs from Bravura. Make sure the font is valid by running “Element =&gt; “Find Problems…”. Once the new glyph(s) has/have been added, you also need to change the version number in the font info (menu “Element” =&gt; “Font Info” and then tab “PS Names” in fields “Version” and “Copyright” and tab “Comment” where you also need to add a comment together with the version number. The file can be saved. Generate the Leipzig font as SVG font From FontForge, export the with menu “File” =&gt; “Generate Fonts…” and select “SVG font” (option “validate before saving” can be turned off). The file needs to be written to ./fonts/Leipzig.svg. Add the glyph to the list of supported glyph in the XSL list Open the file ./fonts/supported.xsl and uncomment the glyph(s) you added to Leipzig. The XSL file is then used to extract the glyphs supported by Verovio Make a PR to the develop-leipzig branch Once the PR will have been merged, the glyphs will be extracted from the SVG font by running the script ./fonts/generate_all.sh (from ./fonts/). This will extract all the glyphs from the SVG font file and calculate the their bounding boxes. When this is done you will see your glyphs in ./data/ and in ./include/vrv/smufl.h"}]
